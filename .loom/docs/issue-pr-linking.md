# Issue ↔ PR Linking

How a Loom-opened PR declares which issue it implements, and why every PR in a
multi-PR landing needs its own declaration. The operative rules live in
`builder-pr.md` → "Multi-PR landings"; this file is the rationale, the
incidents, and the parser contract behind them.

## Why a second, machine-readable link exists

GitHub's `closedByPullRequestsReferences` / `closingIssuesReferences` is the
only structured issue↔PR link the forge gives us, and it exists **only** for a
PR that carries a closing keyword. That makes it structurally blind to every
non-final PR of a multi-PR landing, which is not a rare shape:

- Measured over 329 landed issues (2026-08-15..09-29, issue #9465), **19 of
  329** sweep-landing PRs were absent from that connection entirely.
- **20** issues landed through more than one merged PR on a reused
  `feature/issue-N` branch; one (`example-org/hardware-repo#237`) landed
  through **47**, whose lifecycle churn was up to 835× the final PR's diff.

So "work delivered for issue N" is either under-counted (final PR only) or has
to be recovered by scraping branch names — which is not a link, only a
correlation. The `Loom-Issue: owner/repo#N` trailer is the link: fully
qualified, greppable, and independent of both GitHub's keyword parser and of
matching a prose phrase.

It is deliberately **additive**. It does not replace `Closes #N` (GitHub's
auto-close is still how an issue gets closed) or `Part of #N` (which is what
`merge-pr.sh` parses to fire the #3667 `loom:building` → `loom:issue` reset).

## The trailer contract

```
Loom-Issue: rjwalters/loom#9465
```

- **Owner/repo is required.** A bare `Loom-Issue: #9465` does not parse. The
  whole point is that a consumer reading a telemetry record or a cross-repo
  PR list can resolve the issue without already knowing which repo the PR came
  from — the storyline rollups that motivated #9465 join across repos.
- **Line-leading**, optionally behind a list marker or blockquote, exactly like
  `Part of #N`. A mid-sentence mention is a mention, not a declaration.
- **Plain text, never inside backticks.** See "The backtick pitfall" below.
- Repeatable: a PR may carry more than one trailer (deduped by the parser).

Parser: `loom-daemon merge-pr-refs loom-issue-trailer-refs` (body on stdin,
one `owner/repo#N` per line, deduped and sorted).
`loom-daemon merge-pr-refs loom-issue-trailer-warnings --pr N` reports lines
that *look* like a trailer but will not parse — a backticked one, or one
missing the `owner/repo` slug. Both live in
[`loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/refs.rs`](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom/blob/main/loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/refs.rs).

## Why not `Refs #N`

Issue #9465 asked for `Refs #N` as the non-closing reference. It is **not**
adopted: nothing in Loom parses it. `merge-pr.sh`'s partial-increment guard
matches only `Part of` / `Contributes to`, and that match is what fires the
#3667 label reset on merge. A PR that wrote `Refs #N` instead would look
correct to a reviewer while the reset silently no-opped and the issue sat at
`loom:building` — the exact failure shape of the #5686/#5240 incident below.
One non-closing keyword set, already parsed, plus the new trailer for the
machine-readable half.

## The backtick pitfall (#5234, #8796)

`partial_increment_refs()` blanks inline code spans before matching, on
purpose: #5234 saw a bare `grep` read a backticked, mid-sentence, conditional
mention (``…I will switch the reference to `Part of #4574` ``) as a declared
intent and reopen an issue that had been correctly closed.

The cost of that correct exclusion is that a Builder who writes the
convention's literal syntax — which *reads* like syntax, so it *looks* like it
belongs in backticks — produces a PR that is right to every human reviewer and
invisible to the automation:

```markdown
Part of #123              <- declaration: parsed, the #3667 reset fires on merge
`Part of #123`            <- code span: NOT a declaration, reset silently skipped
```

Merging PR #5686 into #5240 (rjwalters/kicad-tools) did exactly this. Nothing
logged the skip, so #5240 was stranded at `loom:building` until a stale-claim
pass reclaimed it. `merge-pr.sh` now warns (non-blocking) on a whole-line
backticked trailer, but that warning reaches only whoever runs the merge.

The `Loom-Issue:` trailer inherits the exclusion, and has its own detector —
`loom-daemon merge-pr-refs loom-issue-trailer-warnings --pr N` — but that
detector is **not yet invoked by `merge-pr.sh`**: that script is frozen at the
file-size ratchet, so the wiring needs a #8831-style net-zero squeeze plus a
daemon-subcommand version floor, tracked separately. Run the verb yourself (or
have Judge run it) until then.

## A stray closing keyword anywhere in the body defeats `Part of #N` (#4569)

`Part of #N` is not a shield. GitHub does not weigh the two references against
each other — **one** closing keyword adjacent to `#N` anywhere in the body
closes the issue on merge, however explicitly the rest of the body says
otherwise. Observed, not hypothetical: a partial-increment PR ended with the
deliberate trailer `Contributes to #2` plus an operator-handoff section reading

```markdown
## Operator follow-up (after merge)

3. Verify `npm view censusapi` resolves to `0.0.1`, then close #2.   ← closes #2 on merge!
```

GitHub honored that `close #2`. The issue closed on merge and had to be
reopened by hand. (The head branch was `feature/issue-2`, but branch naming was
*not* the cause — `feature/issue-N` creates no Development-sidebar link.)

The remedies are in `builder-pr.md`: never put a closing keyword immediately
before the tracked issue's number (an intervening word breaks the link —
`then close issue #2`), scan the whole body including checklists and
operator-handoff sections, and scan every commit message on the branch too
(#4595 — for consistency: GitHub parses only the PR body and the merge
commit's subject, #9105). `merge-pr.sh` detects the contradiction pre-merge and
reopens the issue if GitHub closed it anyway, but that leaves a close/reopen
flicker plus notification churn — it is a backstop, not the plan.

## What this does not fix

A reliable forge-side link does **not** by itself make `sweep.outcome`'s
`pr_number` / `pr_numbers` populated in the durable store. Those are derived
correctly (PR #9481) but two independent code paths emit `sweep.outcome` for
the same `sweep_id`, and the dashboard's `INSERT OR IGNORE` lets the
impoverished live-collector record win the race — issues #9476 / #9477 own
that. End-to-end "100% of landings resolve to their issue" is measurable only
once both halves have shipped and had a week of real PRs to observe.
