# The `loom:operator` state — "a human is needed"

Loom's coordination substrate is labels (see `CLAUDE.md` § "Label-Based
Workflow") — every pipeline transition (`loom:triage` → `loom:curated` →
`loom:issue` → `loom:building`, `loom:review-requested` → `loom:pr`, etc.) is
a label change on an issue or PR. Before `loom:operator` existed, one state
was the exception: "the engine has stopped and a human is the only way
forward." Champion's merge-risk hold expressed that state as an HTML comment
marker (`<!-- champion:merge-risk-hold -->`) buried inside a PR comment —
invisible to `gh pr list`, the dashboard, or any label-filtered query. See
[#5502](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom/issues/5502) for the incident that
prompted this (four Judge-approved PRs sat held-but-invisible for up to 126
hours).

`loom:operator` moves that state onto the label substrate, where every other
pipeline state already lives.

## Definition

> `loom:operator`: the engine will not work this item further; a human is the
> only transition out.

## Relationship to `loom:blocked`, `loom:operator-only`, and `loom:needs-capability`

Four labels now sit in similar territory. They are **not** consolidated into
one — each answers a different question, and the differences are load-bearing
enough to keep separate (see `.github/labels.yml` inline comments, next to
each definition, for the terse version of this same table):

| Label | Question it answers | Does sweep/shepherd skip it? |
|---|---|---|
| `loom:blocked` | Waiting on a dependency, but still automatable once that clears | No |
| `loom:operator-only` | Requires human action or ruling *outside* automation entirely (credentials, infra, hardware, an owner-gated decision) | **Yes** — sweep/shepherd skip it, except the narrow capability-matched `loom:operator-mechanical` case (#6893, see "Dispatch path" below) |
| `loom:needs-capability` | Blocked on a missing tool/agent capability — not an operator-by-right decision, but automation genuinely cannot proceed without the capability existing first (#5817) | **Yes** — sweep/shepherd skip it, identically to `loom:operator-only` today |
| `loom:operator` | The engine has stopped on this specific artifact and a human must act, but the item stays live in its normal queue so the engine's own release conditions can still fire | **No** — stays in the normal re-evaluation queue |

The distinguishing property of `loom:operator` is that it is **re-evaluable**:
unlike `loom:operator-only`, applying it must never cause sweep/shepherd
dispatch to skip the item. That is what makes it safe to apply to a PR that
still needs to pass through its normal Champion tick — the hold that put the
label on can also be the mechanism that takes it back off, without a human
having to remember to remove it.

## Entry points

| Role | Trigger | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Champion (PR merge) | Posts a merge-risk hold (`champion:merge-risk-hold`) because a safety axis is red (criterion #2) | **Wired** — `defaults/.claude/commands/loom/champion-pr-merge.md`, "Hold behavior" |
| Champion (PR merge) | Posts a critical-file hold (`champion:critical-file-hold`) because criterion #3 matched a critical-file pattern | **Wired** (#6879) — `defaults/.claude/commands/loom/champion-pr-merge.md`, Safety Criteria → 3 → "Durable hold on FAIL" |
| Champion (issue close) | Holds a merged PR's linked **issue** open because one of its acceptance criteria needs out-of-band verification (live source, real scheduled run, observation over time) and no `loom:ac-verified` marker attests it | **Wired** (#6883) — `defaults/.claude/commands/loom/champion-pr-merge.md`, Step 4 → "Out-of-Band Acceptance-Criteria Gate" |
| Builder / Doctor | Encounters work that needs credentials, infra, or a policy ruling outside automation (today's `loom:operator-only` use case) | Not yet wired — follow-up work |
| Judge | A review surfaces a question only a human can answer | Not yet wired — follow-up work |
| Human | Applies the label directly to any issue or PR | Always available (labels are always human-writable) |

**Scope note**: this first pass (#5502) wired only the Champion merge-risk
hold entry point end-to-end; #6879 added a second Champion entry point
(criterion #3's critical-file hold), and #6883 a third (Step 4's out-of-band
acceptance-criteria hold) — all three reuse the same label and the same overall
shape. #6883 is the first entry point that applies the label to an **issue**
rather than a PR; see "The out-of-band AC hold on an issue (#6883)" under the
exit rule for how the exit rule reads there. `curator.md`, `builder.md`, `doctor.md`, `judge.md`,
`champion.md`, `champion-common.md`, `champion-issue-promo.md`,
`champion-reference.md`, `loom.md`, `sweep.md`, and `watch.md` all reference
`loom:operator-only` and/or `loom:blocked` today; none of them assume that set
is exhaustive in a way that required editing for this PR, but none of them
have been migrated to *use* `loom:operator` yet either. Extending
`loom:operator` to the Builder/Doctor/Judge entry points above is explicitly
out of scope here — file a follow-up issue per entry point once the Champion
wiring has run in production.

## Exit rule

`loom:operator` is cleared when the artifact the engine judged **materially
changes** — never merely because a role re-read the same artifact and changed
its mind. For the Champion hold, this reuses the *existing* release precheck
(`champion-pr-merge.md`, "Sticky holds" / criterion #2), which already
computes exactly this distinction for the hold marker itself. `loom:operator`
does not add a second, independent state-tracking mechanism — it piggybacks
on the same four precheck outcomes:

| Precheck outcome | `loom:operator` |
|---|---|
| Never held (`PRIOR_HOLD=false`) | Never applied |
| Held, no release signal yet | Stays applied (label add is idempotent — re-asserted, not re-added, each tick the hold stands) |
| Held, released by `loom:auto-merge-ok` override | Removed in the same pass as the reversal comment |
| Held, released by an explicit operator-comment, a new push (head SHA changed), or a new Judge review | Removed in the same pass as the reversal comment |

A human can also clear `loom:operator` directly at any time by removing the
label — the automated exit rule above is the *default* path, not the only
one.

### The out-of-band AC hold on an issue (#6883)

Champion's Step 4 gate applies `loom:operator` to an **issue** whose acceptance
criteria include a step CI structurally cannot perform, when nothing attests it
was performed (`champion-pr-merge.md` → "Out-of-Band Acceptance-Criteria Gate").
The exit rule reads the same way it does for the PR holds — the artifact must
**materially change** — but the artifact here is the *evidence*, not a diff:

| Event | `loom:operator` on the held issue |
|---|---|
| Someone performs the step and posts a comment ending `<!-- loom:ac-verified sha=<head> -->` | Cleared **by that human**, along with closing the issue — the marker records the evidence, it does not itself trigger a re-scan |
| The criterion is reworded because it was never really out-of-band | Cleared by whoever rewords it |
| Nothing happens | Stays applied — correctly. Nobody has done the thing. |

**There is no automated release for this entry point, and that is deliberate,
not an oversight.** The PR that would have re-evaluated it is already merged, so
no Champion tick returns to it; and the condition it encodes ("a human must
observe something in the world") cannot be discharged by any engine re-read. The
hold comment therefore states the exit path explicitly rather than implying a
later pass will notice. `loom:operator`'s defining property still holds — the
issue stays in every normal queue and is never skipped — so a human, a Curator
re-read, or a fresh sweep can all still act on it.

### The stale-PR route out of `loom:pr` (#5802, narrowed by #6720)

Champion's stale-PR policy swaps `loom:pr` → `loom:changes-requested` on a PR
untouched for 24h, so it reaches Doctor for a rebase. That route now fires from
a **held** state too — before #6720 the sticky-hold bail-out ran first and
dropped the PR from the pass entirely, so the only automated path from `loom:pr`
to Doctor was unreachable for exactly the PRs that most needed it (measured:
21 held PRs, 20 `CONFLICTING`, Doctor's queue empty).

`loom:operator` behaves differently on the two variants, and the split is a
consequence of the exit rule above rather than an exception to it — the question
is only whether the human-needed condition is *resolved* by the departure:

| Stale departure to Doctor | `loom:operator` | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| No hold in force (#5802) | **Removed** | Nothing outstanding requires a human; the label was never applied in the first place, so the removal is a no-op. |
| Hold in force (#6720) | **Kept** | The hold is unresolved and the PR is expected to return still needing a human merge decision. Clearing it would assert "no human is needed" for the whole Doctor round-trip, which is false. |

Keeping the label on that route is safe precisely because of `loom:operator`'s
defining property — it is re-evaluable and **must never cause an item to be
skipped**. The consumers confirm it: Doctor's `loom:changes-requested` queue
excludes `loom:blocked` / `loom:operator-only`, not `loom:operator`; Judge does
not filter on it; sweep C1c's exclusion (#6398) is a *merge*-route skip, which
is what the hold wants; and `verdict-staleness-guard.sh` declines to un-park it
(#5686). Doctor's *Priority 1* queue does exclude `loom:operator` (#5978, so
autonomous work never force-pushes a held PR), but that queue is `loom:pr`-scoped
and the routed PR has just left it.

The `champion:merge-risk-hold` marker comment is **preserved** across this
round-trip. Doctor's rebase is a genuine release *signal* (the diff moved, so the
axes are re-judged), but the *record* of the hold must survive — it is what keeps
`PRIOR_HOLD=true`, and therefore keeps Step 2's hold-reversal comment mandatory
if the PR later merges. A rebase must not launder a held PR into an unheld one.

**#6852 narrows the "Hold in force" row further.** Routing to Doctor on that row
is now conditional on the PR carrying genuine unresolved feedback (a failing
required check) *in addition to* the hold — a **hold-only** stale PR (the hold
is the sole blocker; CI is passing or has no checks) is left on `loom:pr`
instead of being routed, to stop an unproductive "rebase treadmill" where `main`
moving repeatedly forces a rebase that cannot resolve the actual blocker (a
pending human merge decision). `loom:operator` and the hold marker are
unaffected either way — see `champion-pr-merge.md` → "Held-PR Health Pass" →
"#5 under a hold" for the exact routing decision, and "Hold-only Stale PR —
suspend the route" for the suspended path.

## Current implementation

Two Champion entry/exit pairs are wired today, both in the same file:

- **Criterion #2 (merge-risk hold)**:
  - **Entry** — `defaults/.claude/commands/loom/champion-pr-merge.md`, criterion
    #2's "Hold behavior" block (`gh pr edit ... --add-label loom:operator`,
    posted alongside the `champion:merge-risk-hold` marker).
  - **Exit** — the same file's Step 2 ("Add Pre-Merge Comment"), gated on the
    non-empty `$HOLD_REVERSAL_BLOCK` built by the release precheck (`gh pr edit
    ... --remove-label loom:operator`, posted alongside the
    `champion:merge-risk-hold-cleared` marker).
  - **Conditional exit** — the same file's "PR Rejection Workflow → Stale PR"
    block, which removes the label only when no hold is in force
    (`MERGE_BLOCKED_BY_HOLD != true`) and keeps it otherwise; see "The stale-PR
    route out of `loom:pr`" above (#5802 / #6720).
  - Reuses the release precheck at `champion-pr-merge.md` ("Sticky holds — a
    hold does NOT clear on a re-read alone") rather than re-deriving release
    state independently.
- **Criterion #3 (critical-file hold, #6879)**:
  - **Entry/exit** — `defaults/.claude/commands/loom/champion-pr-merge.md`,
    Safety Criteria → 3 → "Durable hold on FAIL" block, run immediately after
    criterion #3's check-loop. `gh pr edit ... --add-label loom:operator`
    alongside the `champion:critical-file-hold` marker on FAIL;
    `gh pr edit ... --remove-label loom:operator` alongside the
    `champion:critical-file-hold-cleared` marker the first time a later push
    no longer matches any critical-file pattern.
  - Needs **no** sticky-hold precheck: criterion #3's check-loop is a
    deterministic file-pattern match, not a judgment call, so there is no
    "same diff scores differently on a later read" case to guard against —
    the FAIL/PASS verdict itself, recomputed fresh every tick, is the release
    signal.

**One consumer honors the hold without ever setting it (#5686)**: the
stale-verdict machinery (`defaults/scripts/verdict-staleness-guard.sh` and
`loom-daemon`'s `reconcile_pr_verdicts`) clears a review verdict whose head SHA
has moved — but **not** on a PR carrying `loom:operator`, `loom:operator-only`,
or `loom:blocked`. Re-queueing such a PR for review would silently un-park it,
which is precisely the transition only a human may make. It still reports the
verdict as stale, so the PR is not merged either; it simply stays exactly where
the operator left it.

## `loom:operator-only` sub-kinds (#5671)

`loom:operator-only` was a single label carrying at least four distinct
meanings — blocked on infrastructure that does not exist yet, mechanical
(host/credential access, no judgement required), a genuine operator decision,
or simply mislabelled as the cautious default — with no way to tell them apart
without reading the issue. A fleet-wide sample found 96 open
`loom:operator-only` issues, only 1 of which named its blocker in a
machine-readable way. That makes triage a reading exercise instead of a label
query, and the pile grows monotonically because nothing can mechanically
distinguish "waiting for something that will resolve itself" from "a human
must rule on this."

**Resolution of the open design question below** (previously "TBD" — see the
now-superseded bullet this section replaces): `loom:operator-only` remains the
distinct, permanent gating label — it is **not** subsumed by `loom:operator` +
a separate skip-dispatch signal. The two labels answer different questions
(see the table above: one causes sweep/shepherd to skip the item entirely, the
other keeps it in the normal re-evaluation queue) and collapsing them would
lose that distinction. Instead, `loom:operator-only` is refined **in place**
by four sub-kind labels applied *alongside* it:

| Sub-label | Meaning | Self-clearing? |
|---|---|---|
| `loom:operator-blocked` | Waiting on a named issue, PR, or piece of infrastructure that does not exist yet — the condition is transient and expected to clear once that lands | Yes — a future pass can safely re-evaluate once the named blocker closes/merges |
| `loom:operator-mechanical` | Needs host or admin access, a credential, or another mechanical action — no judgement required | No (needs the action to happen) |
| `loom:operator-decision` | The act requires authority the operator alone holds — a preference call or an authority act (binds the entity/a third party, irreversible public disclosure, spending/authorisation, credentials only the operator holds, accepting risk on the entity's behalf, physical-world action) | No (needs a human ruling) |
| `loom:operator-objective` | The decision is determined once the operator states an objective — the item names the candidate objectives and the answer under each (#5826) | Yes — clears the moment the objective is given, and one answer often unblocks several items at once |

**Dispatch semantics vs. the "no judgement required" framing (#6881).**
"Self-clearing?" above answers a different question than "does sweep/shepherd
skip it?" — every sub-kind, `loom:operator-mechanical` included, is skipped
identically today, because the skip is implemented once, keyed on the *base*
`loom:operator-only` label (`sweep.md`'s `all`-sentinel taxonomy and Mode C
pre-flight; `loom-daemon/src/work_finder.rs`'s `PARK_LABELS`), and the
sub-kind is additive metadata the skip logic does not currently branch on.
`loom:operator-mechanical`'s "no judgement required" describes the *nature of
the work* — a worker with the right host/credential/admin access could do it
without a ruling — not a claim that it is dispatched differently than
`loom:operator-decision`; the base label wins for all four sub-kinds **unless
the capability lane below applies**.

**Updated by #6893.** The skip is now capability-aware for the mechanical
sub-kind specifically — see "Dispatch path" under the convention below. The
paragraph above still describes the default: a `loom:operator-mechanical` item
with no capability declaration, or one this worker cannot satisfy, is skipped
identically to the other three sub-kinds. What changed is that "no judgement
required" is no longer *only* a routing hint — for a declaring item on a
declaring host it is now a real, narrow, propose-only dispatch path.

### Capability-declaration convention (`<!-- loom:capability=<name> -->`, #6885/#6892)

Before a capability-aware dispatch path (#6885's Part 2, tracked as #6893) can
distinguish "a worker holding the declared capability may attempt this" from
"park it", a `loom:operator-mechanical` item needs a machine-readable way to
state what it needs. This convention defines that marker. **It is meaningful
only alongside `loom:operator-mechanical`** — the other three sub-kinds
(`loom:operator-blocked`, `loom:operator-decision`, `loom:operator-objective`)
ignore it entirely and stay hard-skipped exactly as today, unconditionally,
regardless of whether a marker happens to be present in their body.

**Marker syntax.** Mirrors the `<!-- loom:complexity=<tier> -->` convention
(see `defaults/.claude/commands/loom/curator.md` → "Complexity routing
marker") exactly in form: an HTML comment in the issue/PR body, invisible in
rendered Markdown, trivially greppable. One marker per required capability,
each on its own line:

```html
<!-- loom:capability=host-sudo -->
<!-- loom:capability=cloud-profile:prod-aws -->
```

Unlike the complexity marker (exactly one tier per item), a
`loom:operator-mechanical` item may carry **more than one** capability
marker. Multiple markers are **ANDed** — a worker must hold every declared
capability, not just one of them, before the item is dispatchable. An item
with `loom:operator-mechanical` and **no** marker at all declares no known
capability requirement and stays hard-skipped by the base label exactly as
today, until the dispatch path (#6893) says otherwise.

**Closed vocabulary (small, extensible, fail-closed).**

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `host-sudo` | Needs root/administrator access on the execution host |
| `forge-admin-token` | Needs a GitHub/Gitea token with admin (not just repo-write) scope |
| `cloud-profile:<name>` | Needs a named cloud credential profile, e.g. `cloud-profile:prod-aws` |
| `tailnet-access` | Needs access to the private tailnet/VPN |

The vocabulary is deliberately small — extend it by adding a row here (and
the matching entry in `defaults/scripts/extract-capability-markers.sh`'s
`KNOWN_LITERALS`/`KNOWN_PREFIXES`), not by any item inventing its own value.
**An unrecognized or misspelled value MUST fail closed**: treated identically
to "no capability declared" (the item stays hard-skipped), never silently
ignored or treated as satisfied. This applies symmetrically — an item
declaring a typo'd value is exactly as undispatchable as one declaring
nothing, and (Part 2's concern, not this doc's) a worker's own declared
holds must be checked against the same closed vocabulary.

**Parser convention.** Anchor to the full `<!-- loom:capability=<value> -->`
comment form, never a bare substring — the same anchoring
`require-complexity-marker.sh` uses for `loom:complexity`, and for the same
reason (#4840): prose that merely *quotes* the marker syntax as literal
example text (exactly as this section does above, and as the issue that
introduced this convention did in its own body) must never be mistaken for a
live marker. The value grammar is `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9:_-]*` — lowercase
alphanumerics with `:`/`_`/`-` separators, generalizing the complexity
marker's plain `[a-z]*` to accommodate the colon-parameterized
`cloud-profile:<name>` family. Unlike the complexity marker (`tail -1`, last
match wins because only one tier is ever valid), a capability-bearing item
collects **every** matching marker, deduplicated — the whole declared set
matters, not just the last one written. The whitespace immediately before
the closing `-->` is optional — `<!--loom:capability=host-sudo-->` and
`<!-- loom:capability=host-sudo -->` parse identically — but both reference
parsers anchor extraction on the closing delimiter itself (#6914), so a
value never picks up the delimiter's own leading dashes when there is no
space to stop it first.

A reference implementation of this exact contract lives at
`defaults/scripts/extract-capability-markers.sh` (tests:
`defaults/scripts/tests/test-extract-capability-markers.sh`). Both the Rust
daemon side (`loom-daemon/src/work_finder.rs`, #6893) and any
markdown-orchestration (`sweep.md`) side implementing the actual
capability-aware dispatch check should parse a body identically to that
reference rather than deriving their own regex, so the two surfaces cannot
silently diverge on what counts as a valid marker.

The convention work itself (#6892) made **no dispatch-logic change**. #6893
added the consumer described next.

### Dispatch path (#6893) — propose-only, opt-in per host, fail-closed

Two surfaces read the marker and may route a `loom:operator-mechanical` item
somewhere other than the `loom:operator-only` park:

| Surface | Where |
|---|---|
| Daemon (Tier 2 dispatch) | `loom-daemon/src/capability.rs` + `WorkItem::is_skipped_with_capabilities` / the `SweepRegistry` step-2.7 park guard |
| Sweep (`all` sentinel + Mode C C0) | `defaults/.claude/commands/loom/sweep.md` → "Capability-aware `loom:operator-mechanical` lane" |

Both apply the **same four gates**, in order, and any failure means "skipped
exactly as before":

1. **The host declares capabilities.** `LOOM_WORKER_CAPABILITIES` (a comma- or
   whitespace-separated list of closed-vocabulary values) is set in the
   *environment*. Unset — the default everywhere — makes the whole path inert.
   It is deliberately **not** readable from `.loom/config.json`: a capability is
   a property of the machine and its credentials, and a file committed to git
   must not be able to assert that the host running it has root. A worker's own
   declared values are validated against the same closed vocabulary, so a typo'd
   hold grants nothing.
2. **Labels are exactly the mechanical shape** — `loom:operator-only` **and**
   `loom:operator-mechanical`, and **none** of `loom:operator-decision`,
   `loom:operator-blocked`, `loom:operator-objective`, `loom:needs-capability`,
   `loom:blocked`, `loom:operator`. A contradictory pairing resolves in favour
   of the judgement sub-kind.
3. **The body declares ≥1 marker and every declared value is recognized** (the
   fail-closed rule above; an unknown value is exactly as undispatchable as no
   value).
4. **The host holds every declared capability** (markers are ANDed).

**What the lane may then do is produce a proposal — never a live credentialed
action.** The worker emits the exact commands (or a PR) for an operator to
approve and stops; the item keeps both labels and is not closed. A
live-execution mode is a separate, explicit opt-in that this work deliberately
did not build.

**When a declared capability is not held**, the item still parks — but the
worker leaves a comment naming the missing capability, turning a silent stall
into a capability request.

**When anything encountered turns out to require a judgement call** rather than
mechanical execution, the worker hard-stops and relabels
`loom:operator-mechanical` → `loom:operator-decision` (or
`loom:operator-objective`), which makes the stop durable: gate 2 refuses the
item on every later pass.

`loom:needs-capability` is **unaffected** — different label, different problem
(see "Bidirectional routing" below): it asserts the capability does not exist
yet, which no worker can hold.

### The classifying question, before choosing `loom:operator-decision` (#5826)

"Requires judgement" does not, by itself, identify work only a human can do —
an agent can research, weigh trade-offs, and rule, given grounding. Before
reaching for `loom:operator-decision`, classify the item along a three-way
split instead of asking "how hard is this call":

| Kind | Definition | Correct response |
|---|---|---|
| **Determined** | The answer follows from physics/constraints/prior art once the analysis is finished — nobody has derived it yet | Derive it. This was never a decision — keep working. |
| **Underdetermined** | Multiple defensible answers survive *full* analysis because the objective function is contested | State the candidate objectives (`loom:operator-objective`), or, if the axis is a genuine preference/authority call rather than a missing objective, `loom:operator-decision` |
| **Authority** | Orthogonal to the above — the act requires authority an agent structurally cannot hold, however determined the answer is (see the category list in the sub-label table above) | `loom:operator-decision` or `loom:operator-mechanical`, whichever fits |

**The falsifiability test** — what makes "underdetermined" checkable instead
of a vibe: before labeling anything `loom:operator-decision` for "judgement,"
name the axis along which two well-informed people would still disagree, and
show that axis is a preference, not a fact. If the axis cannot be named, the
item is **not** underdetermined — it is an incomplete analysis wearing a
judgement call as a disguise. Keep working; don't park it.

**Rules for any role applying `loom:operator-only`:**

1. **Confirm this is genuinely operator-by-right before choosing a sub-kind.**
   If the block is really "automation could do this once a specific
   tool/agent capability exists" rather than a ruling only a human can make,
   the correct label is `loom:needs-capability` (below), not
   `loom:operator-only` plus a sub-kind. See "Bidirectional routing:
   `loom:operator-only` ↔ `loom:needs-capability`" below for what to do when
   this distinction is discovered on an issue that already carries
   `loom:operator-only`.
1. **Always apply exactly one sub-label alongside it**, in the same command
   (e.g. `--add-label "loom:operator-only,loom:operator-decision"`) — never
   the base label alone. This is additive: every existing filter/skip/query
   keyed on the base label (sweep pre-flight, `warn-operator-gated.sh`,
   Champion's promotion-queue exclusions, Doctor/Curator's queue exclusions)
   is unaffected, because the base label is never removed or replaced.
2. **Being unsure is a sign the analysis is incomplete, not a reason to apply
   the label (#5826).** `loom:operator-decision` is **not** a safe default for
   "the kind is not obvious" — over-applying it is exactly what regrows the
   pile the sub-kinds exist to drain (measured: bare `loom:operator-only`
   re-accumulated within 12–18 minutes of manual clearing across one
   consuming fleet). When you cannot immediately tell which sub-kind applies:
   re-run the falsifiability test above; if the axis can't be named, finish
   the analysis instead of parking. Only apply `loom:operator-only` once you
   can point to one of:
   - a specific named blocker (→ `loom:operator-blocked`),
   - a candidate-objective list (→ `loom:operator-objective`),
   - a concrete mechanical action (→ `loom:operator-mechanical`), or
   - a nameable preference/authority axis (→ `loom:operator-decision`).

   An item that fits none of these is **not** operator-only — it is ordinary
   work, or, if it's blocked on a missing tool/agent capability rather than
   authority, `loom:needs-capability`.
3. **When the sub-kind is `loom:operator-blocked`, name the blocker in
   machine-readable form**, not only in prose: include a `Blocked by #N` /
   `Depends on #N` / `Requires #N` line in the same comment (same phrasing
   `detect-dependency-cycle.sh` and `warn-operator-gated.sh` already parse via
   regex — see their headers). A backtick-quoted issue reference alone (e.g.
   `` `owner/repo#123` `` in prose) does not satisfy this — the phrase itself
   must be present so a future automated pass can extract it without an LLM
   read. That same machine-readable line (plus an epic-phase issue's
   `**Epic**: #N` header) is also what Curator's read-only "Checking
   Operator-Only Premises" re-check (`curator.md`, #6849) parses to notice
   when a parked issue's named blocker or parent epic has since closed — it
   posts a comment surfacing the finding and never touches this label or its
   sub-kind, so naming the blocker here is what makes that re-check possible
   at all.
4. **When the sub-kind is `loom:operator-decision`, the same comment MUST name
   the disagreement axis and state why it's a preference rather than a fact
   (#5826).** A bare "requires judgement" does not satisfy the rule — apply
   the falsifiability test above and write down its result. An application
   that cannot name the axis is a bug: the item is determined, not
   underdetermined, and belongs in the normal queue.
5. **When the sub-kind is `loom:operator-objective`, the same comment MUST
   list the candidate objectives and the answer under each (#5826)** — not
   just "needs an objective." The point of the sub-kind is that the operator
   can clear it with a single preference statement, which only works if the
   candidates and their downstream answers are already spelled out.
6. **No backfill.** Existing plain `loom:operator-only` issues are not
   required to gain a sub-label retroactively — no code path may assume every
   `loom:operator-only` issue already carries one. The value is in the intake
   rate, not a one-time migration.

**Where this is wired today** — every role that can apply the label (#5819),
with `loom:operator-objective` available to all of them as a fourth choice
(#5826):

| Role | Site | Sub-kind it applies |
|---|---|---|
| Champion | Unrevised-proposal N=2 escalation (`champion-issue-promo.md`), epic-complete-unpromoted escalation (`champion-common.md`) | `loom:operator-blocked` when the recurring finding is itself a live, open dependency; `loom:operator-decision` otherwise |
| Champion | Dependency-cycle detector (`detect-dependency-cycle.sh`, invoked from `champion-issue-promo.md` and `champion-pr-merge.md`), capped-PR close recommendation (`champion-pr-merge.md`) | `loom:operator-decision` — matching their own rationale ("breaking a cycle is a human decision" / "the approach itself is not viable") |
| Curator | "Applying `loom:operator-only`" (`curator.md`) — routing an issue that encodes a still-pending human decision instead of closing it | Caller's choice among all four sub-kinds |
| Builder | "Applying `loom:operator-only`" (`builder.md`) — parking a claimed issue that turns out to need a human; `builder-complexity.md` additionally states that a *size* finding is `loom:blocked`, never this label | Caller's choice among all four sub-kinds |
| Judge | "Applying `loom:operator-only`" (`judge.md`) — an issue surfaced during review, or a PR raising a question only a human can answer | Caller's choice among all four sub-kinds |
| Doctor | "Applying `loom:operator-only`" (`doctor.md`) — the rare case a Doctor session parks a PR it cannot fix without host/credential access (Doctor otherwise only *filters* on the label) | Caller's choice; `loom:operator-mechanical` is the typical Doctor case |

See #5664 for the incident that motivated distinguishing the transient
(`loom:operator-blocked`) case from a genuine decision in Champion's escalation
path, #5819 for the fleet-wide measurement (2 of 78 operator-only issues
across the five busiest repos carried a sub-kind) that motivated wiring the
remaining four roles, and #5826 for the authority/objective split and the
reversed safe-default rule above (motivated by a second fleet-wide
measurement: manual clearing at scale moved the operator-only share from 66%
to only 64.1%, because rule 2's old "safe default" refilled the pile on every
sweep). The prompt-side convention is enforced mechanically by
`defaults/scripts/tests/test-operator-only-subkind.sh`, which fails CI on any
`--add-label` in a role prompt, doc, or script that applies `loom:operator-only`
without a sub-kind in the same argument.

## `loom:needs-capability` — a narrower claim than `loom:operator-only` (#5817)

A fleet-wide census (example-org/fleet-repo#301) found `loom:operator-only` carrying at
least two very different populations under one label: issues that are
genuinely **operator-by-right** (disclosure flips, spending, legal, tier
grants, fleet membership — a human must rule regardless of tooling), and
issues that are simply **unbuilt capability wearing an operator label** —
work automation cannot yet do because a tool or agent capability does not
exist, not because a human's judgement is required. Mixing the two makes the
label unreliable for triage: "this needs a human ruling" and "this needs
someone to build the missing tool first" call for entirely different next
steps, but both looked identical on the forge.

`loom:needs-capability` splits the second population out:

> `loom:needs-capability`: blocked on a missing tool/agent capability, not an
> operator-by-right decision; the filed capability-request issue must be
> linked (e.g. `Depends on #N` / `Requires #N`, the same machine-readable
> convention `loom:operator-blocked` uses above) so a future pass can tell
> when the capability lands.

**Skip parity, by design.** `loom:needs-capability` skips `/loom:sweep`
identically to `loom:operator-only` today — same hard-skip row in the `all`
sentinel's "Aggressive candidate taxonomy" table (`sweep.md`), same skip
condition in Mode C's C0 pre-flight, same dependency-declared check in
`warn-operator-gated.sh` (a candidate that depends on either label is flagged
the same way). Nothing about *routing* differs yet — only the label's
*meaning* is narrower, and the description now records which capability
request must land before a human should reconsider it. This issue (#5817) was
deliberately scoped to the split only; **which label to apply when** and the
bidirectional routing convention are addressed below (example-org/fleet-repo#301's
remaining asks, #5818).

**Additive only.** No existing `loom:operator-only` issue is retagged as part
of introducing this label — example-org/fleet-repo#301 explicitly rejected retrofitting
the existing backlog ("retrofitting 120 issues is not proposed; apply going
forward"). The value is in the intake rate for newly filed/curated issues,
the same "no backfill" principle the operator-only sub-kinds above already
follow.

## Bidirectional routing: `loom:operator-only` ↔ `loom:needs-capability` (#5818)

Splitting the label (#5817, above) answers "which label applies to a *new*
block." This section answers the other half of example-org/fleet-repo#301's asks: what
an agent does when it re-reads an **existing** `loom:operator-only` issue and
recognizes the block was never actually operator-by-right — it is unbuilt
capability that got parked under the cautious label before this split
existed, or before whoever applied it thought to look for the distinction.

**The worked example that motivated this.** example-org/fleet-repo#301 traced this
exact shape through an analog-canary repo's spec-ratification issue, which held three
canaries because it was labeled `loom:operator-only` and nobody had connected
"operator-only" to "the capability this needs — `spec-review`'s ratify
verdict — already exists, it is just forbidden from acting on its own
output." The fix, example-org/tool-repo#204, promoted `spec-review`'s ratify
verdict from advisory to binding: a tool change in the repo that owns the
capability, not a human ruling at all. Recognizing that shape earlier — a
capability that exists but is deliberately non-authoritative, not a decision
only a human can make — is exactly what the relabel below is for.

**When an agent — Curator re-curating a stale issue, Champion re-evaluating a
proposal, or any role that reads an existing `loom:operator-only` block —
determines the block matches `loom:needs-capability`'s definition above
rather than a genuine operator-by-right decision, it relabels using all three
steps together, in the same pass:**

1. **Relabel.** Remove `loom:operator-only` and its sub-kind label (whichever
   of `loom:operator-blocked` / `loom:operator-mechanical` /
   `loom:operator-decision` / `loom:operator-objective` is present — passing
   all four to `--remove-label` is safe even though only one is ever present,
   since a label absent from the issue is silently ignored); add
   `loom:needs-capability`. Do this as one edit, not two separate `gh` calls,
   so the issue is never simultaneously in both hard-skip states:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <number> \
     --remove-label "loom:operator-only,loom:operator-blocked,loom:operator-mechanical,loom:operator-decision,loom:operator-objective" \
     --add-label "loom:needs-capability"
   ```
2. **File or reuse a capability-request issue against the repository that
   owns the missing capability.** Check for an existing one first (the same
   duplicate-detection discipline curation already applies) rather than
   filing a duplicate. This is the same friction-escalation shape every
   canary's `CLAUDE.md` already documents for *tool* friction — a capability
   the agent needs but cannot build itself; this convention generalizes it to
   *decision* friction that turns out to be a capability gap in disguise.
3. **Cross-link both issues, in both directions, in the same pass.** On the
   relabeled issue, comment with a machine-readable `Depends on #N` /
   `Requires #N` line naming the capability-request issue — the same
   convention `loom:operator-blocked` uses above, so a future automated pass
   can tell when the capability lands. On the capability-request issue
   itself, comment naming the issue(s) it unblocks, so anyone landing there
   later can see the downstream effect of building it.

**This is a per-occurrence judgment call, not an automated pass.** Unlike
`loom:operator-blocked`'s self-healing re-scan
(`defaults/.claude/commands/loom/champion-issue-promo.md` → "Pass 0"), there
is no mechanical test for "is this actually a missing capability" — that
determination requires reading the issue. This is documented as something an
agent does opportunistically when it re-encounters the issue (during
re-curation, a bounded evaluation scan, or similar), not as a scheduled sweep
over every open `loom:operator-only` issue. Building that scheduled sweep,
and deciding whether a landed capability request should automatically clear
`loom:needs-capability` the way a closed blocker clears
`loom:operator-blocked`, remain open follow-up work (see below).

**No backfill, same principle as above.** Recognizing this on re-read is
opportunistic, not a mandate to retroactively re-scan the backlog — the same
"apply going forward" principle from "Additive only" above governs this
direction too.

## Follow-up work

- Wire `loom:operator` into Builder/Doctor's credential-or-policy stop path
  (today's `loom:operator-only` usage). **Still open** — #5819 wired the
  *sub-kind requirement* into those paths, but they still route to
  `loom:operator-only` (skip-dispatch), not to the re-evaluable
  `loom:operator`.
- Wire `loom:operator` into Judge's unanswerable-question path. **Still open**,
  same distinction as above.
- Build the actual self-healing re-evaluation pass that `loom:operator-blocked`
  makes possible (re-check the named blocker, un-escalate when it clears) —
  tracked separately in #5664; this document only defines the label the
  self-healing pass keys off.
- Build a scheduled self-healing pass over open `loom:needs-capability` issues
  that auto-clears the label once its linked capability-request issue closes
  — the `loom:operator-blocked` equivalent of the re-scan tracked in #5664.
  Deliberately not built in #5818: the *relabel-and-link* convention
  documented above is a per-occurrence judgment call an agent makes on
  re-read, not something a mechanical closed-dependency check can drive (see
  "This is a per-occurrence judgment call, not an automated pass" above).
