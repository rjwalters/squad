#
# Supports both GitHub and Gitea forges. Forge detection is automatic

#
# Options:
#   --no-cleanup-worktree  Skip local worktree AND local branch cleanup after
#                          merge
#   --cleanup-worktree     (no-op, worktree cleanup is now the default)
#   --worktree-path <dir>  Explicit worktree path to clean up (bypasses
#                          .loom-managed sentinel guard — caller asserts
#                          responsibility). Also deletes the matching local
#                          branch via `git branch -d` (refuses on unmerged
#                          commits — Git's own safety check).
#   --dry-run              Show what would happen without merging
#   --auto                 Wait for this head's checks to settle, then merge in
#                          THIS process (immediately if they are already
#                          settled). It never arms the forge's own server-side
#                          auto-merge queue (#8410): that queue is gated only by
#                          the branch ruleset's REQUIRED checks and re-reads
#                          nothing, so a merge armed at queue time ignored both
#                          a later loom:pr revocation and every non-required
#                          test suite. Bounded by LOOM_AUTO_MERGE_TIMEOUT
#                          (default 600s; raise it on a slow-CI repo); exits
#                          non-zero on timeout or a failed required check,
#                          which Champion's next pass retries.
#   --allow-stacked-children
#                          Bypass the pre-merge merge-ordering guard's hard-block
#                          path. That guard's DEFAULT behavior, when the parent
#                          branch (feature/issue-N) still has open stacked child
#                          PRs targeting it, is now to pin the parent's tip to
#                          refs/loom/parent/<branch> and proceed with a WARNING
#                          (see #7982) — it only still hard-blocks when the tip
#                          could not be pinned (a detached/unreadable parent).
#                          This flag skips straight past that remaining block
#                          (operator asserts responsibility, mirroring
#                          --worktree-path). See #3747 item 2.
#   --allow-unapproved     Bypass the pre-merge loom:pr review-signal guard,
#                          which otherwise hard-blocks merging a PR whose
#                          current head carries no loom:pr label (no
#                          forge-visible signal Judge reviewed it — e.g. a
#                          Doctor rebase cleared it via the staleness guard).
#                          The bypass is recorded as a warning and, on a real
#                          (non-dry-run) merge, best-effort as a PR comment
#                          audit trail. Operator asserts responsibility,
#                          mirroring --allow-stacked-children. See #7419.
#   --no-cleanup-primary   Skip the automatic primary-checkout branch cleanup
#                          (#5015): when the merged branch is checked out in
#                          the PRIMARY repo checkout (not a worktree) and it
#                          is provably safe (clean tree, no stash entries,
#                          tip matches the merged PR head SHA), the script
#                          normally checks out the default branch there and
#                          deletes the merged branch automatically instead of
#                          just printing manual instructions. Pass this to
#                          always print the manual instructions instead.
#   --cleanup-primary      (no-op, primary-checkout cleanup is the default)
#
# By default, the local worktree AND the local branch it held are cleaned up
# after a successful merge (#4100). Pass --no-cleanup-worktree to skip both
# (e.g., when other terminals may have their CWD inside the worktree, or the
# branch has unpushed commits you want to keep).
#
# Cleanup is restricted to Loom-managed worktrees (those containing the
# .loom-managed sentinel written by worktree.sh). Worktrees lacking the
# sentinel are treated as user-owned and never removed. Set
# LOOM_PRESERVE_WORKTREE=1 to disable cleanup unconditionally for a session.
#
# Local branch deletion (#4100): every cleanup path — the default
# .loom/worktrees/issue-N convention, a discovered Loom-managed worktree at a
# non-standard path, and even the case where no worktree exists at all —
# attempts to delete the merged PR's local branch. Safety is determined by
# whether the local branch tip equals the merged PR's head SHA (not by `git
# branch --merged`, which is always false for a squash merge): a matching tip
# uses `git branch -D` (every commit on the branch was part of the merged PR);
# a non-matching tip (unpushed local work) falls back to `git branch -d`,
# which keeps the branch and reports it instead of force-deleting. A branch
# checked out as the current HEAD (or in another worktree) is never deleted —
# git itself refuses, and the refusal is reported with a specific message
# rather than the generic "unmerged commits" warning. The repo's default
# branch is never a delete target.
#
# Primary-checkout auto-cleanup (#5015): the one case above that is "checked
# out as the current HEAD" AND is specifically the repo's PRIMARY checkout
# (not a linked worktree) gets one extra step: if the tip-matches-head safety
# check already passed AND the primary checkout's working tree is clean with
# no stash entries (re-checked immediately before the mutating step, not
# cached), the script checks out the default branch there and force-deletes
# the branch automatically. A dirty tree, a stash entry, a tip mismatch, or
# --no-cleanup-primary all fall back to printing the manual two-step
# instructions unchanged.
#
# Override: pass --worktree-path <dir> to opt into removing a non-Loom
# worktree (the sentinel guard is bypassed only when this flag is supplied).
# Discovery: if neither the default issue-N nor pr-N worktree exists, the
# script walks `git worktree list --porcelain` looking for a worktree whose
# branch matches the merged PR's head branch. It emits a hint (not an
# auto-remove) so the operator can re-run with --worktree-path.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = merged
#   1 = failed
#   3 = PR head moved past the SHA this merge attempt gated on (#5579) — a
#       session pushed new commits to the branch after the approving review
#       (or after this run's own head-SHA read). NOT a merge failure: the PR
#       is still Judge-approved, its diff just changed underneath it. Callers
#       (notably champion-pr-merge.md Step 3) must treat this distinctly from
#       exit 1 — re-queue the PR for a fresh pass rather than posting a
#       failure comment. See "Squash-merge detection trap" in
#       defaults/docs/merge-pr-exit-code-exceptions.md for why ancestry checks
#       can't verify this state after the fact.
#   4 = stale required checks re-run/re-dated under --redate-stale-checks:
#       the #8248 guard blocked the merge; this run re-ran them IN PLACE
#       (#8914, needs Actions: write; head + loom:pr kept) or pushed a
#       tree-identical no-op commit (#8508). Nothing bypassed. Same contract as
#       exit 3 — re-queue, never a failure comment. Bounded to one push per
#       head; a repeat block escalates to a loom:operator hold and returns
#       exit 1 with the original refusal. Full rationale:
#       defaults/docs/merge-pr-exit-code-exceptions.md.
#   5 = --auto's bounded settle-wait expired before this head's checks
#       finished (or before the check-runs API became readable) — #8896. CI
#       simply outlasted LOOM_AUTO_MERGE_TIMEOUT: nothing merged, nothing
#       failed, no required check went red. Same caller contract as exits 3
#       and 4 — re-queue for a later pass, never a failure comment. Reachable
#       on any repo whose suites outrun the default 600s (this one's `Shell
#       Test Suites (hermetic)` alone takes ~10 minutes), and especially on
#       the pass right after an exit-4 --redate-stale-checks re-run.

# Which route a FAILED merge's forge error TEXT sends the retry loop below down

# (#5579 — the PR's OWN head moved past the SHA we gated on, so retrying would
# either fail again or silently merge a diff Judge never approved),
# base-modified (the PR's BASE fell behind; rebase-and-retry is correct), other
# (stop). String provenance stays documented on forge_merge_pr in
# lib/forge-helpers.sh — GitHub REST and Gitea verified against each forge's own
# source/spec, the GitHub GraphQL `expectedHeadOid` spelling best-effort from the
# retired server-side arm (#8427).
#
# This replaces three separate `grep` matchers in three separate `if` blocks
# whose relative ORDER was the entire safety property: a head-mismatch reaching
# the base-modified arm answers a moved head with forge_update_branch and another
# merge attempt. Nothing asserted that order except an `awk` scan over THIS
# FILE's source text looking for which `grep` appeared first. It is now one
# ordered `match` in loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/response.rs, pinned by a
# differential against the frozen retired ladder
# (loom-daemon/tests/merge_pr_response_differential.rs) and by the precedence
# unit tests beside the module. Asymmetric case-sensitivity is preserved
# verbatim: the head-mismatch alternation was `grep -Ei`, its two siblings bare
# `grep -q`.
#
# Returns 3 when no route could be OBTAINED — which the caller must never
# collapse into the `other` route. Fails CLOSED there, deliberately: the routes
# are not interchangeable, so an unresolvable binary leaves only "guess a route"
# or "refuse and say which happened", and only the second is distinguishable
# from a merge verdict afterwards. It cannot stop a healthy merge — a merge that
# SUCCEEDS never reaches this function; only one that already failed does.
#
# `printf '%s'`, not the retired `echo "$1"`: bash's `echo` silently swallows an
# argument that is exactly -n/-e/-E, and the response is arbitrary forge bytes.
# The differential's corpus includes those three inputs, so that substitution is
# checked to change no answer rather than assumed equivalent.

# attribution check, not just the asynchronous-push one. One extra round trip
# buys uniform attribution instead of two different safety levels for the same
# claim ("this new head is our own sync").

# returns, exiting 3 through error_head_moved() exactly as before.
#
# The decision is `loom-daemon merge-pr head-sync-retry` (Rust,
# loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/head_sync.rs — slice 4 of the merge-pr port #8191),
# which authorizes a retry only when the new head is a two-parent merge whose
# FIRST parent is the head we were about to merge and whose SECOND parent is
# already contained in the base branch. Under that shape the new head's
# content is (approved head ∪ base) and nothing else — the same tree the merge
# would have produced. Attribution is structural, never the commit message:
# a message is attacker-supplied text, parent SHAs are not. Any other shape
# (a rebase-style update, a commit pushed on top, a merge of some other
# branch) stays the #5579 hard stop.
#
# Fails safe by construction: only exit 0 PLUS the sentinel retries, so a
# missing/old/substituted binary, a forge read failure, or any silent failure
# lands on the pre-#8164 behaviour — exit 3, re-queue — which is why this

Loom PR Merge - Worktree-safe merge using forge API (GitHub or Gitea)

Usage: ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh <pr-number> [options]

Merges a PR via the forge API (not 'gh pr merge') to avoid
"already used by worktree" errors when merging from inside a worktree.

Supports both GitHub and Gitea forges. Forge detection is automatic
(see forge-helpers.sh for details).

Options:
  --no-cleanup-worktree  Skip local worktree AND local branch cleanup
                         after merge
  --cleanup-worktree     (no-op, worktree cleanup is now the default)
  --worktree-path <dir>  Explicit worktree path to clean up. Bypasses the
                         .loom-managed sentinel guard (caller asserts
                         responsibility — this is the documented opt-in
                         for removing non-Loom worktrees). Also deletes
                         the matching local branch via 'git branch -d'
                         (Git refuses on unmerged commits).
  --dry-run              Show what would happen without merging
  --auto                 Wait (bounded) for this head's checks to settle, then
                         merge in THIS process — immediately if they already
                         are. NEVER arms the forge's server-side auto-merge
                         queue, which re-reads neither the loom:pr label nor
                         the non-required test suites once armed (#8410).
  --allow-stacked-children
                         Bypass the pre-merge merge-ordering guard's remaining
                         hard-block path. By default (#7982) the guard pins
                         the parent's tip to refs/loom/parent/<branch> and
                         WARNS instead of blocking when open stacked CHILD PRs
                         target the parent branch (feature/issue-N) — see
                         #3747 item 2. It still hard-blocks only when the tip
                         could not be pinned; this flag skips past that.
                         Operator asserts responsibility, mirroring
                         --worktree-path.
  --allow-unapproved     Bypass the pre-merge loom:pr review-signal guard.
                         By default the script refuses to merge (exit 1) a
                         PR whose current head does not carry the loom:pr
                         label — the only forge-visible signal Judge
                         reviewed that head (it may have been cleared by a
                         staleness guard, e.g. after a Doctor rebase). This
                         flag bypasses that block; the operator asserts
                         responsibility, mirroring --allow-stacked-children.
                         The bypass is always logged as a warning and, on a
                         real (non-dry-run) merge, best-effort recorded as a
                         PR comment audit trail too.
  --redate-stale-checks  On an #8248 freshness block, re-run the stale checks in
                         place and merge once fresh (#8914), else push a tree-
                         identical no-op commit and exit 4 (#8508) — never a
                         bypass; a repeat push block escalates to loom:operator.
  --merge-method M       Request squash|merge|rebase instead of auto-detect; validated via loom-daemon against the repo's actually-allowed strategies — fails rather than silently falling back to squash if disallowed (#8845).
  --no-cleanup-primary   Skip automatic primary-checkout branch cleanup (#5015).
                         When the merged branch is checked out in the PRIMARY
                         repo checkout (not a worktree), the script normally
                         auto-checks-out the default branch and force-deletes
                         it there ONLY when provably safe (clean tree, no
                         stash entries, tip matches the merged PR head SHA).
                         Pass this to always print manual instructions instead.
  --cleanup-primary      (no-op, primary-checkout cleanup is the default)
  -h, --help             Show this help and exit

By default, the local worktree AND the local branch it held are cleaned up
after a successful merge (#4100). Pass --no-cleanup-worktree to skip both
(e.g., when other terminals may have their CWD inside the worktree, or you
want to keep a branch with unpushed commits).

Cleanup is restricted to Loom-managed worktrees (those under
.loom/worktrees/issue-N that contain a .loom-managed sentinel file written
by worktree.sh). User-provisioned worktrees at other paths are never
removed by the default code path. Set LOOM_PRESERVE_WORKTREE=1 to disable
cleanup unconditionally for a session.

Local branch deletion (#4100): every cleanup path — including the case
where no worktree exists at all — attempts to delete the merged PR's local
branch. Safety is determined by comparing the local branch tip to the
merged PR's head SHA (not 'git branch --merged', which is always false for
a squash merge): a matching tip uses 'git branch -D'; a non-matching tip
(unpushed local work) falls back to 'git branch -d', which keeps the
branch and reports it instead of force-deleting. The branch currently
checked out (main worktree or any other) is never deleted, and the repo's
default branch is never a delete target.

Primary-checkout auto-cleanup (#5015): the one exception to "checked out
branches are never deleted" is when the branch is checked out in the repo's
PRIMARY checkout specifically (not a linked worktree) AND it is provably
safe — the tip-matches-head safety check above passed, the primary
checkout's working tree is clean, and it has no stash entries. In that case
the script checks out the default branch there and force-deletes the merged
branch automatically instead of just printing instructions. Pass
--no-cleanup-primary to always print the manual instructions instead.

When --worktree-path <dir> is passed explicitly, the operator is taking
responsibility for the cleanup decision: the sentinel guard is bypassed
for that one path. The path is validated against 'git worktree list'
and rejected if it is not a worktree of this repository.

Discovery fallback: if neither .loom/worktrees/issue-N/ nor
.loom/worktrees/pr-<PR_NUMBER>/ exists, the script walks
'git worktree list --porcelain' looking for a worktree whose branch
matches the merged PR head branch. It NEVER auto-removes a discovered
user-owned worktree; it only logs the path and suggests re-running with
--worktree-path <found-path>.

Precedence (highest wins):
  1. LOOM_PRESERVE_WORKTREE=1     (always skip cleanup)
  2. --no-cleanup-worktree        (always skip cleanup; warns if combined
                                  with --worktree-path)
  3. --worktree-path <dir>        (explicit path; bypasses sentinel)
  4. default: .loom/worktrees/issue-N or pr-N + sentinel guard

Exit codes:
  0 = merged (or --help)
  1 = failed
  3 = PR head moved past the SHA this attempt gated on (#5579) · 5 = --auto's bounded settle-wait expired before CI finished (#8896) — neither is a failure; retry later
  4 = stale required checks re-running in place (#8914) or re-dated by a push (#8508) under --redate-stale-checks — not a failure; retry later

Examples:
  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123
    Merges PR #123 (squash), deletes remote branch, cleans up worktree

  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123 --dry-run
    Shows what would happen without merging

  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123 --auto
    Waits (bounded by LOOM_AUTO_MERGE_TIMEOUT) for PR #123's checks to
    settle, then merges it here — never via a server-side merge queue

  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123 --no-cleanup-worktree
    Merges PR but leaves the local worktree in place

  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123 --worktree-path ../adhoc-wt
    Merges PR #123 and removes the worktree at ../adhoc-wt plus its
    matching local branch (bypasses the .loom-managed sentinel guard).

  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123 --no-cleanup-primary
    Merges PR but always prints manual instructions instead of
    auto-cleaning a branch checked out in the primary repo checkout.

  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123 --allow-unapproved
    Merges PR #123 even though it does not carry loom:pr (no forge-visible
    Judge review signal for the current head). Logs a warning and posts a
    PR comment recording the override.

# invoked here, above the "Merging PR" line — not next to item 1's POST-merge
# _auto_reconcile_stacked_children at the bottom of the merge flow).
#
# The decision is `loom-daemon merge-pr stacked-children` (Rust,
# loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/stacked_children.rs — #8191 slice): discover open
# CHILD PRs still targeting this parent branch via a LIVE forge query (never the
# daemon registry), then ESTABLISH the postcondition reconcile-stack.sh needs by
# pinning the parent tip to refs/loom/parent/<branch> rather than merely
# asserting it — GitHub deletes the branch synchronously inside the merge call,
# so item 1's post-merge rebase would otherwise race the repo's own
# delete_branch_on_merge setting and lose. It hard-blocks on exactly one case:
# the tip could not be pinned at all. --allow-stacked-children skips past that
# block; --dry-run reports the would-be outcome and writes no ref.
#
# It emits `CHILDREN`/`PIN-WRITTEN`/`WARNING`/`BLOCK<TAB>line` records, replayed
# below through this script's own warning/error so the operator-visible text is
# unchanged from before the port. `CHILDREN` carries the pre-merge snapshot the
# post-merge reconcile prefers (#8010 item 2); `PIN-WRITTEN` fires only where a
# ref was actually written, which is what the item-3 re-pin must gate on (a
# bypass finds children without pinning). The two globals are plain (non-local)
# assignments so they survive this function returning, and are read as
# `${VAR:-}` everywhere else so a standalone invocation still behaves as before.
#
# Exit 1 WITH a BLOCK record refuses; any other non-zero is a guard FAULT and
# warns-and-proceeds. Unlike every gate below this one, that is fail-OPEN, and
# deliberately: this guard protects a best-effort POST-merge cleanup step, not
# the question of whether this tree may merge, so a skip costs one manual
# reconcile against a SHA the warning prints — while failing closed would stop
# every merge on a host whose daemon lags one release, nearly all of which have
# no stacked children at all. It is also safe by construction: the fail-CLOSED
# `verdict-contradiction` gate runs on this same binary further down, so a
# daemon too old for this verb cannot reach the merge anyway. Full argument:
# the module docs on loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/stacked_children.rs.
#
# _mp_daemon_roll_hint is not yet defined this early in the script (it lands

# Pre-merge loom:pr review-signal guard (#7419).
#
# `loom:pr` is the only forge-visible statement that the CURRENT head passed
# Judge review. Champion's auto-merge path (champion-pr-merge.md) already
# refuses to merge without it, but this shared script — driven directly by
# humans and in-session agents, not just Champion — previously merged
# whatever PR it was pointed at regardless of label state. That gap let a
# real incident through: a Doctor rebase cleared `loom:pr` via the staleness
# guard, and a human running this script directly moments later squash-merged
# a head no Judge had reviewed, with zero friction at the one point it was
# cheap (#7419).
#
# Default is a hard block (error, exit 1) — the same shape as
# _check_no_open_stacked_children / _check_defaults_version_bump_collision
# above — printing the CURRENT label set and head SHA so the operator can see
# exactly what they are about to merge. --allow-unapproved bypasses the
# block (operator asserts responsibility, mirroring --allow-stacked-children
# and --worktree-path); the bypass is always recorded as a loud warning
# (mirrors --allow-stacked-children's own override warning) and, on a REAL
# run only (never --dry-run — a preview must have zero forge side effects),
# best-effort recorded as a PR comment audit trail too, mirroring the
# _post_premature_close_comment / partial-increment comment pattern already
# used elsewhere in this file. --dry-run reports the would-be block without
# exiting 1 or merging, same dry-run contract as both guards above.
#
# A present `loom:pr` is the overwhelmingly common case and must add zero
# overhead on that path: labels were already extracted from the initial
# $PR_JSON fetch into $PR_LABELS above, so this needs no extra API call to
# pass through.
#
# AC #3: when `loom:pr` IS present, also WARN (never hard-block — presence of
# loom:pr already means Judge approved SOME head, just possibly not the
# current one, which is a softer signal than the missing-label case above) if
# a Champion `<!-- champion:hold-state head=<sha> -->` marker (see
# champion-pr-merge.md's own hold-state tracking) names a SHA that differs
# from the current head. forge_get_pr's response has no `.comments` (unlike
# champion-pr-merge.md's own `gh pr view --json comments,...` fetch), so this
# needs the dedicated forge_get_pr_comments() helper (lib/forge-helpers.sh).
#
# The marker extraction and the staleness comparison are
# `loom-daemon merge-pr hold-state` (Rust, loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/
# hold_state.rs -- #8191 slice). Only the forge READ stays here, so this
# script keeps owning the GitHub/Gitea split forge_get_pr_comments encodes.
# The retired `grep -o '...head=[0-9a-f]*' | tail -1 | sed` pipeline lost this
# warning silently in two ways the port fixes: `[0-9a-f]*` also matched the
# documentation line `head=<sha>` (quoted in champion-pr-merge.md and in this
# file), and `tail -1` then let that empty capture erase a real hold's SHA;
# and a bare substring anywhere -- prose, backticks, an example -- counted as
# recorded state, the hazard Champion's own reader answered with `startswith`
# (#5371). See the module docs for both, and for the fence-stripping
# divergence deliberately NOT taken.
#
# Advisory, so it fails OPEN, unlike every gate around it: a binary that
# cannot run this check has not found a reason to stop the merge, and turning
# "could not warn" into a refusal would make an advisory note more fatal than
# the gates. The fault is still said out loud rather than swallowed.

# Pre-merge verdict-label contradiction guard (#8112).
#
# A PR can carry BOTH `loom:pr` (approved) and a blocking verdict/hold label
# simultaneously — two concurrent Judge passes reaching different verdicts on
# the same head ~45s apart is a real, observed incident (PR #8076), not a
# hypothetical. `_check_loom_pr_label` above only checks loom:pr's ABSENCE; it
# has no way to see a contradicting label standing beside a PRESENT loom:pr.
#
# Judge/Doctor's Verdict-Time CAS Recheck (judge.md / doctor.md) and
# Champion's Verdict-State Janitor Part 1 (champion-pr-merge.md) already exist
# to prevent and auto-resolve exactly this contradiction — but both live in
# markdown-orchestrated agent steps, not in this script, so a human or agent
# invoking merge-pr.sh directly (the documented, canonical way to merge —
# never `gh pr merge`, see CLAUDE.md) bypasses them entirely. This guard is
# the backstop at the one point every merge path actually funnels through.
#
# Deliberately no bypass flag: --allow-unapproved overrides "nobody reviewed
# this head" (an absence of signal); this guard blocks "a reviewer explicitly
# said no" (a present, contradicting signal). Those are different acts, and
# only the first has a documented override. The fix for a real block here is
# a fresh Judge verdict, not a flag.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DAEMON VERSION FLOOR (#8285)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script hard-requires two loom-daemon subcommands and fails CLOSED when
# the resolved binary predates either. Failing closed is right — an empty
# answer from the closing-reference analysis is indistinguishable from "no
# closing refs", which would silently close an unfinished issue — but the
# version floor has to be SAYABLE, or the refusal cannot tell an operator what
# to roll to. These two markers are that declaration. They are the single
# source of truth: `_mp_daemon_roll_hint` below reads them back out of
# ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} at refusal time, and
# scripts/check-daemon-subcommand-versions.sh enforces that no NEW daemon
# dependency lands here (or in any other shell script) without one.
#
# On 2026-09-18 a host running 0.19.161 against a `main` that carried 0.19.170+
# stopped every merge outright — `.loom/scripts` is a symlink into
# `defaults/scripts` in the primary checkout, so the floor moved the instant
# `main` was pulled, while the auto-update loop deferred ~4.5h behind the
# build-stampede guard (#8252). The refusal named neither the version nor the
# roll command. That is what these markers and the hint below fix.
#
# requires-daemon: merge-pr >= 0.19.465   the NEWEST fail-closed verb in this family, not the oldest (#8967): checks-failure (#8191 slice, merged in #9272 at 0.19.464, so first released in 0.19.465); the other fail-closed verbs are partial-conflict >= 0.19.464 (#9246), classify-response >= 0.19.456 (#9228), loom-pr-guard >= 0.19.375 (#7419/#8926), stale-checks >= 0.19.221 (#8248/#8416) and verdict-contradiction >= 0.19.172 (#8112/#8124). One marker covers the whole `merge-pr` family, so it MUST name the highest of them — a host that satisfied an older floor but not the newest fail-closed verb had every merge refused while the hint quoted a floor it already met. Fail-open verbs (head-sync-retry, hold-state, redate-checks, delete-branch, zero-checks-settle, check-runs-streak, stacked-children, version-policy, partial-reset, partial-comment, closed-building, issue-close-gate, dirty-guard, worktree-preserve, worktree-contains, cleanup-paths — partial-comment renders two POST-merge audit comments and skips the note rather than posting an empty one; the last four decline only the post-merge worktree removal, never the merge; worktree-preserve preserves the worktree when the verb is missing, worktree-contains declines --worktree-path's override cleanup and keeps that path when it is missing, and cleanup-paths leaves the cleanup targets unnamed so nothing is removed) deliberately do NOT raise it; the fail-direction table in tests/test-merge-pr-daemon-version-floor.sh enforces both halves.
# requires-daemon: merge-pr-refs >= 0.19.170   closing-reference analysis (#8191, landed in #8199)
# requires-daemon: forge optional   --merge-method validation (#8845); command -v probes first, and any non-0/1 exit (older daemon lacking the subcommand, or a Gitea decline) falls back to the unvalidated request with a warning
# The `merge-pr >=` floor above covers the whole subcommand group, including
# #8191's post-merge porcelain lookups (`merge-pr worktree-primary` /
# `worktree-branch-for` / `worktree-find-by-branch`, see _mp_worktree, plus the
# --worktree-path parse-time `worktree-contains` check), and it is
# deliberately NOT raised to their landing version. Raising it refuses the MERGE
# on every host one release behind — the 2026-09-18 incident above — whereas a
# daemon missing only those leaf verbs declines post-merge CLEANUP: the two
# branch lookups degrade to "delete nothing" and the #3710 primary-worktree guard
# refuses the removal rather than force-removing on no evidence. Skipped cleanup
# is recoverable (`loom-clean`, the daemon's reaper, `worktree.sh remove`);
# removing the primary checkout is not. Leaving the floor where it is also keeps
# _mp_daemon_roll_hint's `${sub} >= ` lookup resolving to the merge-gate version,
# which is the one a refused MERGE should name.
# requires-daemon: cargo-target-dir optional   #9153 — the post-merge #7239 target-dir reclaim; without the resolve|reclaim verbs a daemon prints nothing, `$target_dir_resolved` stays empty and no reclaim is attempted, which is the pre-#7239 behaviour. A missed disk reclaim, never a failed merge: post-merge cleanup is best-effort by design and `loom-clean`, the daemon's reaper and `worktree.sh remove` all reclaim the same directory on their own schedule.
# requires-daemon: notify-cleared-blockers optional   #9102 — the post-merge close-triggered loom:blocked re-check; a daemon lacking the verb exits non-zero, `_notify_cleared_blockers` prints one warning and the merge proceeds. A delayed notice, never a failed merge: the next sweep's `check-stale-blocked` pre-wave pass reports the same stale block.
# requires-daemon: record-rework optional   #9444 — the two in-sweep rework markers this script emits (a `rebase` when it syncs a base that moved, a `merge_conflict` when it refuses a PR that genuinely conflicts). Both calls are `>/dev/null 2>&1 || true`: a daemon lacking the verb records nothing and the merge is byte-for-byte unaffected. Pure telemetry — the cost of a missing marker is one under-reported environmental rework in `sweep.outcome`'s `rework_events`, never a merge that did or did not happen.
#
# _mp_daemon_roll_hint <subcommand> [resolved-bin] -- the concrete, host-local
# remediation for "your loom-daemon is too old for <subcommand>": the declared
# floor, what the resolved binary actually reports, the artifact-first roll
# command for THIS host, and the two fallbacks when no artifact carries the
# floor yet. Written as a one-liner because merge-pr.sh is frozen by the
# file-size ratchet (scripts/check-file-size-budget.sh) and may not grow.
#
# Both reads carry `|| true` deliberately. merge-pr.sh runs under `set -euo
# pipefail`, and a bare `x="$(cmd)"` assignment adopts cmd's status — so an
# unreadable ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} or a `--version` that exits non-zero would abort
# THIS function partway, and the caller (an `error "… $(…)"` argument) would
# print a refusal with the remediation silently truncated off the end. A
# best-effort diagnostic must never be able to degrade the message it is
# decorating. (The `if` over a `[[ … ]] && { … }` is for the same reason stated
# defensively; bash exempts AND-lists from `set -e`, so that one is style.)

# Pre-merge required-check freshness guard (#8248).
#
# THE INCIDENT: main went red on 2026-09-18 while every gate worked. #8078's
# File Size Ratchet ran green at 2026-09-17T22:54Z; #8204 tightened that
# baseline entry 1845->1815 at 11:45Z the next day; #8078 hand-merged at 20:31Z
# with its 22h-old green result never re-run, landing 1816 onto a 1815
# baseline. A check result is evidence about ONE tree; a ratchet baseline is
# repo-global mutable state. When the base branch moves (especially when a
# ratchet tightens), an in-flight PR's green results become statements about a
# world that no longer exists — and the forge keeps displaying them green,
# because branch protection only asks "did this check pass on this head SHA?".
#
# THE RULE: a green run of a REQUIRED check whose start predates the commit
# time of the base branch's current tip is not evidence about the tree this PR
# will merge onto. The decision (recorded, #8248): options (1) this guard and
# (2) narrowing check-file-size-budget.sh --update both ship; option (3)
# (branch ruleset requiring up-to-date branches) is rejected — it forces a
# rebase per merge at a cadence this fleet (125-commits-behind PRs are
# ordinary) would pay constantly.
#
# Scope choices, so review does not have to infer them: only GREEN runs (a
# stale failure already blocks via branch protection); only REQUIRED contexts
# (informational checks are not merge evidence); a required context with no
# run at all is left to the forge's own BLOCKED state (one mechanism per
# behaviour, ci-principles rule 4); pending runs are left to the wait paths
# (no verdict yet, so no stale evidence). FAILS CLOSED when the guard cannot
# run or cannot determine either timestamp — an unknown freshness must refuse,
# never pass (ci-principles rule 6). GitHub-only: Gitea's status API (which
# forge_get_check_runs maps from) carries no run timestamps.
#
# The decision itself is `loom-daemon merge-pr stale-checks` (Rust,
# loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/stale_checks.rs — slice 3 of the merge-pr port,
# #8191), which resolves the base tip, the required contexts (rulesets +
# classic protection, #8103) and the head's check runs itself, and prints a
# refusal naming the check and BOTH timestamps. 0 + the LOOM-STALE-CHECKS-
# CLEAN sentinel = fresh; 1 = stale (refusal on stdout); anything else —
# including a missing/old binary that does not know the subcommand — is
# rewritten to a fail-closed refusal below, mirroring the verdict-label guard
# above (#8112). --dry-run reports the would-be block without exiting 1, same
# dry-run contract as every guard here. No bypass flag: overriding "this
# evidence is stale" is not an operator assertion like --allow-unapproved
# (missing review); the remedy is re-dating the check (re-run the job or push
# any no-op commit), which is cheap and always correct.
#
# --redate-stale-checks (#8508) makes this script PERFORM that remedy instead
# of only naming it. It is not a bypass: nothing about the refusal changes,
# the merge still does not happen, and the next attempt still needs a check
# that genuinely started at/after the base tip. The gap it closes is that
# nothing in the fleet produced the fresh evidence — a Champion tick's token
# has no actions:write, so neither an internal re-run nor `gh run rerun` can
# re-date the check, and a PR whose branch has no new commits can never escape
# on its own (PR #8493 failed three identical ticks that way on 2026-09-21).
# `loom-daemon merge-pr redate-checks` FIRST re-runs the stale runs in place (#8914: exit 5 = fresh, merge on; no commit, verdict kept), and only if that is refused (no Actions: write) pushes a TREE-IDENTICAL no-op commit,
# which re-triggers CI; exit 0 there means "re-running/re-dated, do not merge this pass"
# and becomes THIS script's exit 4. It is bounded to one push per head — a
# second block on an already-re-dated head means CI cannot out-race the base
# branch, and the PR is escalated to a durable loom:operator hold (exit 4 from
# the subcommand) with the original refusal still returned here. Deliberately
# NOT given a requires-daemon floor of its own: an older binary that does not
# know `redate-checks` exits non-zero like any other remedy failure, which
# leaves the #8248 refusal standing — the feature degrades to exactly today's
# behaviour instead of failing a merge open, so it is optional by
# construction. Full rationale, bound and release conditions:
# defaults/docs/merge-pr-exit-code-exceptions.md. Known residual: this guard
# is evaluated once, here, and `--auto` may then wait out CI before merging
# (bounded by LOOM_AUTO_MERGE_TIMEOUT) — #8410 deliberately does NOT re-run it
# after that wait (see `_revalidate_merge_guards`), leaving the same
# minutes-scale window the pre-#8410 UNSTABLE wait path always had, not the
# 22-hour exposure this guard exists to close; #8410 also removed the
# server-side queued path this note used to describe.
#
# PLAN-GATED REPOSITORIES (#8844): on a PRIVATE repo owned by a GitHub Free
# account or org, `GET /repos/{nwo}/rules/branches/{branch}` answers "HTTP 403:
# Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public to enable this feature."
# That used to fail the guard closed, i.e. block EVERY merge on such a repo
# with no flag that helped. The daemon now recognises that ONE message (not the
# status code — a missing token scope is a 403 too) as "this repository's plan
# has no rulesets, so nothing can be a REQUIRED check", returns CLEAN, and says
# so as a `Warning:` on stderr. Which is why the invocation below no longer
# discards stderr: stdout still has to be exactly the sentinel (it is compared
# for equality), so stderr is the only place that warning can go, and a
# relaxation nobody sees is how a fail-open ships unnoticed. Every other
# failure (network, auth scope, rate limit, 404, 5xx) still exits 2 and still
# refuses the merge. That exit-2 reason arrives on STDOUT (the daemon captures
# gh's own stderr internally), which is why the refusal below QUOTES the
# captured $msg instead of overwriting it (#8873) — otherwise the operator got
# a generic "could not run" naming neither the forge's complaint nor the real
# remedy. The build/install remedy is only offered when the subcommand printed
# NOTHING (missing binary, rc=127, or one too old to know the subcommand).
#
# This file is at its file-size-ratchet ceiling (file-size-policy.md), so the
# function is one dense line and the two MAX_MERGE_RETRIES/MERGE_RETRY_DELAY

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Partial-increment closing-keyword conflict detection (#4569, extended by
# #4595 to cover commit messages).
#
# ROOT CAUSE (established from the rjwalters/censusapi#5 -> censusapi#2 incident,
# NOT from the branch-name theory the report floated):
#
#   GitHub's closing-reference parser scans the ENTIRE PR body and honors ANY
#   `close|closes|closed|fix|fixes|fixed|resolve|resolves|resolved` that is
#   IMMEDIATELY followed by `#N` — wherever it appears, including buried in
#   prose, inside a list item, or mid-sentence. It is NOT limited to a
#   line-leading trailer.
#
#   censusapi PR #5 ended with the deliberate non-closing trailer
#   `Contributes to #2`, but an earlier "Operator follow-up (after merge)" step
#   read "...then close #2". GitHub honored that `close #2` as a real closing
#   reference and closed issue #2 on squash-merge, silently defeating the #3599
#   partial-increment convention. The evidence:
#     - issue #2's timeline has NO `connected` event, so there was no
#       Development-sidebar / branch-name link -> the `feature/issue-N`
#       branch-name auto-link hypothesis is RULED OUT;
#     - the squash commit message contained only `Contributes to #2` (no closing
#       keyword), so the close did not come from the commit message either;
#     - the `closed` event has `commit_id: null` with the merger as actor at the
#       merge instant — the signature of a PR-body closing-reference close.
#
# SECOND SOURCE (#4595): the same parser also runs over the SQUASH COMMIT
#   MESSAGE. forge_merge_pr() squash-merges with no commit_title/commit_message
#   override, so GitHub composes that message from the PR's own commit messages —
#   a stray `close #N` in any commit message closes #N on merge even when the PR
#   body only ever says `Part of #N`. That close is fully attributable (the
#   `closed` event carries the merge `commit_id`), it is just invisible to both
#   the body regex and `closingIssuesReferences`, so the commit messages are
#   consulted as a third signal below.
#
# Fix shape: DETECT (here, pre-merge, with a loud actionable warning) plus
# SELF-HEAL (post-merge reopen in _reset_one_partial_issue below). Prevention by
# rewriting the PR body at merge time was rejected — mutating a body the Judge
# already reviewed is a worse failure mode than a seconds-long close/reopen.
#
# Two globals are published for the post-merge pass, both space-separated:
#   PARTIAL_OPEN_BEFORE_MERGE - partial-increment refs that were OPEN right
#       before the merge (so "closed afterwards" is attributable to this merge).
#   PARTIAL_CONFLICT_ISSUES   - the subset that ALSO carries a closing reference
#       from this PR, i.e. the ones GitHub is about to close against the
#       declared intent. Only these are auto-reopened; that keeps a deliberate
#       human close inside the merge window (which carries no closing reference)
#       from being reverted.

# (#5234): a bare `grep` over the whole text also matched a mid-sentence,
# backticked, conditional mention like "...say so and I will switch the
# reference to `Part of #4574`" — prose describing a hypothetical, not a
# declared intent — and treated it as authoritative, reopening a correctly
# closed issue. To count as a declaration here the keyword must be
# line-leading, optionally preceded by a list marker (`-`/`*`/`+`/numbered
# `1.`/blockquote `>`) and/or whitespace — matching the actual shape this
# convention produces (a one-line `Part of #123` / `Contributes to #456`
# trailer, per builder-pr.md), not prose that merely references the pattern.
#
# Fenced code blocks are stripped first, then inline code spans (`` `...` ``)
# are blanked so a backticked mention cannot itself satisfy the line-leading
# anchor (the #5234 repro used backticks specifically to mark the reference as
# hypothetical, not live).
#
# The second stage extracts `#N` tokens FIRST and only then strips the `#`.
# Scanning the whole matched span for any digit run would also pick up the
# numbered-list marker's own ordinal (`3. Part of #789` -> `3` and `789`),
# which is exactly the false-positive-reopen class this guard exists to
# prevent: a body carrying both `3. Part of #789` and a genuine `Closes #3`
# would see #3 registered as a declared partial increment AND a closing
# reference, and get reopened right after a correct close.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Partial-increment label reset (#3667).
#
# A PR that implements only a slice of a family/epic issue references it with a
# NON-closing keyword — `Part of #N` / `Contributes to #N` (convention in
# builder-pr.md) — deliberately so the issue survives the merge for further
# work. GitHub never auto-closes such an issue, and the merge path otherwise
# leaves `loom:building` orphaned on it: the #2838 "skip label cleanup on close"
# decision only reasoned about the `Closes #N` auto-close case, where GitHub
# closes the issue and stale labels on closed items are harmless. Nothing else
# reclaims the label until a time-gated `/sweep all` stale-claim pass (>=2h),
# and non-aggressive sweeps hard-skip the still-`loom:building` issue
# indefinitely (issue #3667).
#
# Here — at the deterministic merge choke point — we swap each such still-open,
# still-`loom:building` referenced issue back to `loom:issue`, mirroring
# orphan_recovery.py's recover_issue() label-reset semantics (loom:building ->
# loom:issue, i.e. return to the ready queue). No liveness check is needed: a
# merge just happened on the PR that necessarily came from whoever held the
# claim, so the current increment's work is provably done — a deterministic,
# not heuristic, signal. Closing keywords (`Closes`/`Fixes`/`Resolves`) are NOT
# matched — GitHub auto-closes those and the #2838 no-cleanup path stays
# untouched.
#
# GitHub-only for v1 (guarded on FORGE_TYPE); merge-pr.sh already branches on
# forge type elsewhere. Every step is best-effort and must never fail the merge.

# Reset a single referenced issue's labels if — verified fresh at merge time —
# it is still open and still carries loom:building (reopening it first when
# this very merge auto-closed it through a stray closing keyword, #4569).
# Idempotent: a no-op when the issue is already closed, already lacks
# loom:building (e.g. re-claimed by a second builder), or is actually a PR.
#
# The decision — which of those cases this is, and the log text for each — is
# `loom-daemon merge-pr partial-reset` (Rust, loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/
# partial_reset.rs — #8191 slice), fed the fresh issue body on stdin. It prints
# the steps in order: `INFO`/`WARNING<TAB>text` to replay, `REOPEN`, `SWAP`.
# Only the mutations and their audit comments stay here. The fresh read uses
# plain `gh api` (uncached; not $GH, which may be gh-cached) so a stale cached
# view cannot mask a re-claim. Best-effort like the rest of this pass: a daemon
# that cannot plan (missing, or predating the verb) is a warning naming the
# manual swap, never a guessed mutation. The plan is read on fd 3 so no forge
# call below can consume it from stdin.

# Both bodies are `loom-daemon merge-pr partial-comment` (Rust,
# loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/partial_comment.rs — #8191 slice), byte-frozen from
# the shell that used to build them here; only the POST stays, behind #4856's
# rate-limit-safe wrapper.
#
# The bodies moved for the reason this file exists: they were ~40 lines of pure
# text in a script the size ratchet freezes, and NOTHING asserted either of them
# — the retained suite stubs the comment post, so a mangled interpolation or a
# lost `$reopen_note` would have shipped silently. They now have unit tests and
# a byte-for-byte differential against the frozen retired shell
# (loom-daemon/tests/merge_pr_partial_comment_differential.rs).
#
# Fails OPEN, and deliberately: both comments are posted AFTER the mutation they
# describe (the #4569 reopen, the #3667 label swap), and the merge itself is
# long done — so a body that cannot be rendered costs the note, nothing else.
# But it must never post SILENCE over the audit trail, which is what a bare
# `comment="$(… || true)"` would do against a daemon predating the verb. Only
# output led by the LOOM-MERGE-PR-COMMENT sentinel is posted; anything else is a
# warning naming what is missing.
#
# `$nl` holds the sentinel's terminating newline in a plain variable rather than
# writing `$'\n'` inline in the two patterns below. Both places are PATTERNS —
# a `[[ ]]` right-hand side and a `${var#…}` word — and bash only began
# processing `$'…'` inside those relatively late (it is literal `$'\n'` on
# macOS's stock /bin/bash 3.2, which this repo supports and has been bitten by
# before: #7717/#7721/#4242). Getting it literal would fail in BOTH directions,
# silently and only off-Linux: the `[[ ]]` would never match, so every macOS
# host would skip both comments with a warning, and if only the strip were
# literal the sentinel line would be posted as the body's first line. A plain
# `$nl` expansion is unambiguous on every bash. The ANSI-C quote in the
# *assignment* is fine everywhere — that use has worked since bash 2. Inside the

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Closed-issue `loom:building` cleanup (#6199).
#
# The #2838 "no label cleanup on close" decision reasoned that a stale label
# on a closed issue is harmless — every queue query filters on open state, so
# it can never cause a duplicate build or a blocked candidate. That is still
# true. What #6199 found is that the decision also has a real, if narrow,
# cost: any consumer that reasonably reads `loom:building` as "in flight"
# WITHOUT also filtering on state — a dashboard, a capacity check, an
# operator `gh issue list --label loom:building` spot-check, or a future tool
# — gets pure noise once the population of closed-but-still-labelled issues
# grows (observed: 20 stale claims on one consumer repo, 0 real ones). The
# label has stopped meaning what its name says for anyone who doesn't already
# know to filter it out.
#
# Scope decision (recorded here per #6199's own "worth deciding deliberately"
# note): this pass covers ONLY the merge-driven auto-close path (`Closes #N`
# / `Fixes #N` / `Resolves #N`, resolved the same way Champion's "Verify
# Issue Auto-Close" step does — via GitHub's GraphQL
# `closingIssuesReferences`, see forge_pr_close_targets above) — the
# deterministic case merge-pr.sh already owns and can act on right at the
# confirmed-merge choke point, with zero extra liveness/state ambiguity: a
# merge just happened on the PR that closed the issue, so the label is
# unconditionally stale. An issue closed OUTSIDE a merge (closed manually, as
# a duplicate, or `--reason "not planned"` by an autonomous role) is
# deliberately OUT OF SCOPE here — merge-pr.sh has no hook into that path at
# all, and inventing one (e.g. polling every issue close event) is
# disproportionate to a cosmetic-but-annoying defect. That population is
# instead handled by the standalone, idempotent
# `clean-stale-building-labels.sh` (same directory) — run once against this
# repo as part of #6199 to clear the accumulated backlog, and safe to re-run
# on demand (by an operator, or wired into a periodic role) for any future
# manual-close stragglers. See that script's header for the full rationale.
#
# Runs AFTER _reset_partial_increment_labels (and therefore after any #4569
# premature-auto-close revert) so an issue that pass just reopened is no
# longer `closed` by the time this pass reads it — reopened partial-increment
# issues must keep `loom:building` (they return to `loom:issue` instead, via
# that pass), never lose the label outright.
#
# GitHub-only for v1 (guarded on FORGE_TYPE), mirroring
# _reset_partial_increment_labels's gating — forge_gh_remove_label_rl_safe is
# a `gh`-specific helper. Every step is best-effort and must never fail the
# merge.

# Strip `loom:building` from one issue this merge closed, if it is still
# present. Idempotent: a no-op when the issue isn't actually closed (a
# transient PR-close-target false positive, or #4569 reopened it above),
# already lacks the label, or is actually a PR.
#
# The decision — which of those cases this is — is `loom-daemon merge-pr
# closed-building` (Rust, loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/closed_building.rs — #8191
# slice), fed the fresh issue body on stdin. It prints exactly one line:
# `STRIP`, or `SKIP<TAB><reason>` which this pass deliberately discards (the
# retired function's skips were silent and stdout stays byte-identical). Only
# the mutation stays here. The fresh read uses plain `gh api` (uncached; not
# $GH, which may be gh-cached) so a stale cached view cannot mask a fresh
# re-claim — the same freshness discipline _reset_one_partial_issue keeps.
# Best-effort like the rest of this pass: a daemon that cannot decide, or that
# answers with anything but the two known lines, is a warning naming the manual
# removal, never a guessed mutation. Silence is NOT read as `SKIP`.

# Automated stacked-PR reconciliation on parent merge (#3747, stacked-PR v2,
# item 1 of the v2 epic — the remaining five items stay deferred).
#
# When a stacked PARENT PR (branch feature/issue-<N>) squash-merges, any CHILD
# PRs based on the parent branch still carry the parent's now-squashed pre-merge
# commits. reconcile-stack.sh performs the git surgery — `git rebase --onto
# <default> <parent-branch> <child-branch>`, `push --force-with-lease`, retarget
# the child PR base to the default branch — that strips them. v1 (#3729) shipped
# reconcile-stack.sh as a STANDALONE, operator-invoked script and deliberately
# left merge-pr.sh untouched. This v2 slice fires it AUTOMATICALLY here — a
# best-effort, GitHub-only step gated so it never races a live Builder that still
# holds the child branch checked out.
#
# Discovery is via a LIVE forge query (`gh pr list --base <parent>`), NOT the
# ephemeral loom-daemon SweepRegistry: terminal registry entries are
# garbage-collected ~1h after transition and the registry only exists at all when
# loom-daemon is running, but this function may run from Champion's cron or an
# interactive /loom:sweep merge with no daemon present (see
# .loom/docs/daemon-reference.md → "Stacked-PR dependency").
#
# Safe/unsafe split per child, gated on the child ISSUE's loom:building label
# (fresh, uncached `gh api` read, mirroring _reset_one_partial_issue's freshness
# discipline):
#   - Safe   (child issue NOT loom:building): no live claim on the child, so
#            invoke reconcile-stack.sh directly.
#   - Unsafe (child issue still loom:building): a live Builder likely has the
#            child branch checked out in its own worktree; an out-of-band rebase
#            + force-with-lease would corrupt its in-progress work. Skip the
#            auto-rebase and post a comment noting reconciliation is deferred
#            until the Builder finishes (a later parent-merge-triggered pass, or
#            a manual reconcile-stack.sh run, picks it up).
#
# Idempotent by construction: once a child's base is retargeted away from the
# parent branch, `gh pr list --base <parent>` returns zero rows, so re-runs are
# no-ops and nothing double-fires.
#
# Every step is best-effort and must NEVER change merge-pr.sh's exit code — the
# parent merge already happened. Runs BEFORE branch deletion so the parent
# branch ref still resolves as reconcile-stack.sh's rebase <upstream> argument.

# The two decisions here are `loom-daemon merge-pr reconcile-plan` and
# `merge-pr reconcile-child` (Rust, loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/reconcile.rs —
# #8191 slice). The plan owns the parent-branch gate, the children-rollup parse
# and each child's derived issue number; the child verb owns safe/unsafe and the
# deferral comment's byte-frozen text. Everything with an EFFECT stays here: the
# live `gh pr list` discovery (never the daemon registry), the uncached `gh api`
# label read, the reconcile-stack.sh invocation and the #4856 comment post.
#
# Why these: the retired shell wrote the `feature/issue-<N>` predicate out TWICE
# — once as the parent gate, once as the child derivation, 90 lines apart against
# two different variables — and reached the force-push-authorising answer through
# three stacked `|| echo '{}'` / `|| true` layers that each turn a failed lookup
# into the empty string, which `grep -qx` then reports as "no claim". That is the
# one wrong answer in this file that rebases a branch a Builder still has checked
# out. The port keeps the same disposition (force-with-lease is the remaining
# protection) but makes it a decided one, and it is now impossible to match
# `loom:building-paused` by widening a `grep`.
#
# Fail direction: OPEN, like the pre-merge sibling `merge-pr stacked-children`.
# A missing or older daemon prints no sentinel, and the seam then WARNS and skips
# auto-reconciliation for this pass — exactly the disposition the pre-existing
# "reconcile-stack.sh not found" skip already has. This runs after the merge has
# already happened and cannot make a merge wrong, so it must not be able to stop
# one; the cost of a skip is the one manual reconcile-stack.sh invocation every
# message on both routes already prints. That is why it raises no
# `requires-daemon: merge-pr` floor. Silence is never a route: `reconcile` (the
# force-pushing one) is reachable only through a positive sentinel.

# The roll-this-host remediation both skip paths below append. Guarded with
# `declare -F` exactly as the other fail-open seams (#3747 item 2, #7827,
# partial-reset, closed-building) are: `_mp_daemon_roll_hint` is defined ~700
# lines above, OUTSIDE the span test-merge-pr-auto-reconcile.sh extracts and
# sources, so an unguarded call would put `command not found` into the one
# message whose whole job is to tell an operator what to do next.

# Stale-cached-mergeable recheck before refusal (#6104).
#
# GitHub's REST `.mergeable` field is computed asynchronously and invalidated
# on every push to the base branch. On a repo with continuous automated
# merges it can read a stale `false` shortly after a base-branch push even
# though the branch would merge cleanly against current main. The gate at
# the synchronous-merge callsite previously trusted the first `.mergeable`
# read and refused immediately, asserting a conflict that did not actually
# exist.
#
# This function, called only once `.mergeable` has already read `false`:
#   1. Re-queries PR state via the UNCACHED recheck path
#      (forge_get_pr_nocache) after a short backoff, up to `retries` times.
#      Uses the uncached path deliberately — $GH may be wrapped by
#      `gh-cached` (see merge-pr.sh's $GH setup), and re-reading through that
#      cache would keep returning the same stale value, defeating the
#      backoff entirely (mirrors the existing _NRC_RECHECK_JSON pattern).
#   2. If still `false` after all retries, corroborates with a local
#      `git merge-tree` check against the freshly fetched base ref — this is
#      what lets the caller distinguish "the forge's cached state is
#      stale/unknown" from "this branch genuinely conflicts" (a real
#      conflict will also fail `git merge-tree`).
#
# Usage:
#   _recheck_mergeable_before_refusal NWO PR_NUMBER GH_CMD BASE_REF HEAD_REF REPO_ROOT [RETRIES] [DELAY]
#
# Echoes exactly one "<action>:<reason>" line on stdout, always returns 0 (the
# decision is conveyed via stdout, not exit status, so callers under
# `set -e` can safely capture it with `$(...)`):
#   merge:<reason>            - proceed with the merge (recheck succeeded, or
#                                merge-tree independently confirms clean).
#   refuse-conflict:<reason>  - refuse; local git merge-tree independently
#                                confirms a real conflict.
#   refuse-stale:<reason>     - refuse; the forge's cached state never
#                                resolved to true, and local corroboration was
#                                unavailable (missing refs, fetch failure) —
#                                NOT a confirmed conflict, just unresolved.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `--auto`'s whole implementation: settle this head's checks, then merge HERE
# (#3820, generalised to every `--auto` invocation by #8410).
#
# It polls the head-SHA check-runs (bounded by LOOM_AUTO_MERGE_TIMEOUT) until
# they settle, then returns 0 so the caller merges synchronously. "Settled"
# means: nothing queued/in_progress, and nothing failing except checks that are
# NOT in the base branch's required-context set. An already-settled head costs
# exactly one check-runs read and returns immediately, so the CLEAN case is not
# slowed down by the wait existing.
#
# #8410 — why this is now the ONLY `--auto` path, and the forge's own
# server-side auto-merge queue is never armed:
#
#   Arming that queue (enablePullRequestAutoMerge) hands the merge decision to
#   the forge, which re-reads NOTHING afterwards except the branch ruleset's
#   REQUIRED status checks. Two things this script enforces stop being enforced
#   the moment it is armed:
#     1. Label state. A later `loom:verdict-stale` revocation (loom:pr ->
#        loom:review-requested) or a Judge `loom:reviewing` claim cannot disarm
#        a queued merge.
#     2. The non-required suites. On this repo every required context is a
#        structural gate; the test suites (Rust Unit Tests, Shell Test Suites,
#        Installer Integration Tests, Native Port Suites, Rust OTLP) are NOT
#        required, so the server was free to merge while they were still
#        running.
#   Both fired live on PR #8220 (2026-09-20): armed at 07:08 on a head that was
#   force-pushed at 07:12, `loom:pr` revoked at 07:13, Judge re-claimed it at
#   07:18, merged by the queue at 07:21 with five suites still pending.
#
#   The UNSTABLE case never had this problem — the forge REFUSES to arm when a
#   required check is mid-flight, so the script already fell back to this
#   function (#3486/#3664). The BLOCKED case (no required check has started
#   yet) is the one where arming succeeds, and it is exactly the case where
#   waiting matters most. Rather than keep two paths whose safety differs by
#   which checks happen to be running at the instant of the call, `--auto` now
#   always takes this one (ci-principles rule 4, one mechanism per behaviour).
#   The cost, accepted deliberately: the invoking process must stay alive for
#   up to LOOM_AUTO_MERGE_TIMEOUT, and a slower CI than that budget makes the
#   run exit non-zero instead of queueing — Champion's next pass retries and
#   merges immediately once the checks are done.
#
# Contract:
#   - returns 0  → safe to proceed to the synchronous-merge path (caller flips
#                  AUTO_MERGE=false). Also returned if the PR merged concurrently
#                  while waiting (the synchronous path's own race-detection then
#                  no-ops cleanly).
#   - calls error() (exit 1) → a required status check failed, or the wait timed
#                  out. A normal recoverable failure Champion's cron retries.
# Requires LOOM_AUTO_MERGE_POLL_INTERVAL / LOOM_AUTO_MERGE_TIMEOUT set.
# LOOM_ZERO_CHECKS_SETTLE_POLLS / LOOM_ZERO_CHECKS_SETTLE_INTERVAL (#9091) are
# read and validated by `loom-daemon merge-pr zero-checks-settle`, not here.

# that ran at the top of this script — loom:pr present, no contradicting
# verdict label, and the head they were evaluated against — are re-checked
# against freshly-read state immediately before the merge fires. That re-check
# is precisely what an armed server-side merge structurally cannot do, and it
# is the half of this fix that closes the label-revocation gap (the wait itself
# closes the pending-test-suite gap).
#
# Deliberately NOT re-run here: the #8248 required-check freshness guard. Its
# input is the BASE branch's tip, which moves every few minutes in this fleet,
# so re-evaluating it after a multi-minute wait would refuse nearly every PR
# that actually had to wait — with "re-run CI" as the only remedy. Widening
# that guard to cover the wait window is a separate policy call; the window
# left here is the same one the pre-#8410 UNSTABLE wait path always had.

# Cleanup worktree if requested.
#
# Ownership model (see issue #3334): Loom owns worktrees it created under
# .loom/worktrees/ (marked with a .loom-managed sentinel file by worktree.sh
# or pr-worktree.sh). Any worktree lacking the sentinel is treated as
# user-owned and is never removed by this script. Operators can also set
# LOOM_PRESERVE_WORKTREE=1 to skip cleanup unconditionally.
#
# Two worktree-path conventions are recognized:
#   - .loom/worktrees/issue-<N>/  (Loom-issue branches: feature/issue-<N>;
#     the Builder's worktree)
#   - .loom/worktrees/pr-<N>/     (external-fork / ad-hoc branches, #3358;
#     OR a Judge/Doctor review worktree for an ordinary feature/issue-<N>
#     branch created via pr-worktree.sh when no builder issue-<N> worktree
#     was present at review time, #6264)
#
# A pr-<N> worktree of the LATTER shape can exist ALONGSIDE an issue-<N>
# worktree for the same PR (the builder worktree is created/reused after the
# Judge's pr-<N> review worktree, or vice versa) — the merge-time cleanup
# below checks for both when PR_BRANCH matches feature/issue-<N>, not just
# the issue-<N> path (#6264: previously only the external-fork branch ever
# considered a pr-<N> path, so a co-existing Judge review worktree on an
# ordinary issue branch was never cleaned up and survived the merge).
#
# Branch-to-issue regex is the strict `^feature/issue-([0-9]+)$` pattern so
# branches like `release-1` or `fix-bug-42` correctly classify as PR-style
# (not issue-style) and clean up the right worktree.
# Porcelain parsing for post-merge cleanup, ported to Rust (#8191 slice).
#
# The `git worktree list --porcelain` calls stay HERE; only the parse moved
# (loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/worktrees.rs). Every one of this family's shipped
# defects was in the awk — #3671 (the `exit`-triggers-`END` double-print, which
# handed callers a `/path\n/path` that exists nowhere), #3717 ($2 truncating a
# space-containing path, so the primary-worktree guard compared a prefix and
# never fired), #4171 — and every consumer is an irreversible step: `git
# worktree remove --force`, `git branch -D`. The newline-in-path caveat (#3717)
# is unchanged: `--porcelain -z` is still the real fix and is still this
# script's to make, since the `git` invocation never left.
#
# Contract: exit 0 + the answer, exit 0 + EMPTY for "parsed, no match", and
# non-zero for "the parse could not run at all". The last two must stay
# distinguishable — _remove_loom_worktree's #3710 guard reads an empty primary
# path as "the target is not the primary checkout" and proceeds to remove it.
#
# Resolved inline, not via lib/locate-daemon-bin.sh, for the same reason
# _mp_refs is (above): the retained suites extract these functions and source
# them alone, with no libs present. LOOM_DAEMON_SELF_BIN first per #8134; a
# PINNED path that is unusable refuses rather than silently resolving a
# different binary off PATH. Unlike _mp_refs this NEVER calls `error` — it is

  # collide deterministically whenever two hosts/sessions independently claim
  # the same issue number. When a *different*, still-live builder has that
  # branch checked out with unsaved edits, the blanket `git worktree remove
  # --force` below would silently destroy them (observed 2026-08-03 on #5001:
  # a live sibling session lost its in-flight, never-committed edits). The
  # neighbouring guards check only *identity/ownership* (primary-worktree #3710,
  # .loom-managed sentinel), never *live content*, so none of them catch this.
  # Refuse-and-warn instead: the merge itself already succeeded, so skipping
  # cleanup is a safe no-op for the merge while the sibling's work survives on
  # disk to be committed/pushed. The clean common case is unaffected — a
  # worktree that already committed+pushed the merged PR reports no changes, and
  # Loom's own gitignored runtime markers (.loom-managed / .loom-in-use /
  # .loom-checkpoint / .no-changes-needed / .loom-cargo-target-dir / .snapshots/)
  # are filtered out so a bare/stale checkout that surfaces them as untracked is
  # still removed. `.loom-cargo-target-dir` (#8458) matters most here: it is born
  # in EVERY opted-in worktree, so a consumer repo with a stale `.gitignore` block
  # would otherwise see every post-merge cleanup refuse — turning the per-worktree
  # target dir into the very leak the scheme exists to close. That filter is not
  # spelled here: the list is `worktree_ops::safety::LOOM_OWN_UNTRACKED_FILES`,
  # asked through `is_loom_own_untracked_path` by the `merge-pr dirty-guard` port
  # below (#8191 slice), which is also what the removal-side paths consult.
  #
  # Not to be re-conflated in triage (distinct root causes):
  #   - #4463 (closed): same-HOST duplicate dispatch — fixed lock *ownership* so
  #     a live sweep's lock is not stolen by a peer's reaper. That is about lock
  #     records, not worktree/branch-name collision, and would not have caught
  #     #5031 (the colliding worktree came from a separate host that never
  #     touched this daemon's lock).
  #   - #4146 (open, loom:operator-only): *measures* the cross-host collision
  #     rate (observation only, behavior unchanged on collision by design). This
  #     guard is the behavioral mitigation for the data-loss instance #4146 is
  #     meant to eventually quantify.
  #
  # The three decisions — which porcelain lines are user work rather than Loom's
  # own runtime markers, whether the remainder plausibly IS in-flight work
  # (#5658), and the refusal text — are `loom-daemon merge-pr dirty-guard`
  # (Rust, loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/dirty_guard.rs — #8191 slice). Only the
  # porcelain READ stays here, on purpose: `git status` FAILING has always meant
  # "no dirt, proceed" on this path (the #5177 orphaned-directory case cleanup
  # exists for), and the `|| true` that encodes that must not migrate into an
  # exit code the guard would read as a fault. The port retires the THIRD copy
  # of Loom's marker list (#8195 slice 3 deleted worktree.sh's twin after
  # #8279) and closes two holes in the retired `grep -vE`: a rename INTO a
  # marker name was filtered as bookkeeping though it is a tracked-file change,
  # and a marker under a git-quoted path was counted as user work.
  #
  # The refusal arrives as `LEVEL<TAB>message` lines replayed through this
  # script's own warning/echo — the shape `merge-pr delete-branch` established —
  # so the operator-visible text is unchanged. `PLAIN` is the uncolored `echo`
  # the remediation command is pasted from. $live_branch is now resolved on
  # every removal rather than only the dirty path (one extra local

# Async-close-race adaptation (#4186, adapted from fork PR #77's open-issue
# worktree guard).
#
# Removing a worktree unconditionally after merge breaks the partial-
# increment lifecycle (#3667): a `Part of #N` / `Contributes to #N` PR merges
# while issue N stays open, and the next Builder increment (or an agent still
# inside it) needs that worktree. But naively querying the issue's LIVE state
# right after merge has a race: GitHub closes `Closes #N` issues
# ASYNCHRONOUSLY, after the merge webhook fires — so a lookup taken here
# would see "open" for essentially every normal merge and silently defeat
# cleanup entirely. Gate the live lookup on whether this PR is actually a
# close target of the issue:
#
#   - $issue_number IS a close target of $PR_NUMBER -> the merge itself
#     closes it; clean up exactly as before this change (no lookup, no
#     race).
#   - $issue_number is NOT a close target (partial increment, or no closing
#     keyword at all) -> query live state via forge_get_issue_state and
#     preserve the worktree unless that state is CLOSED.
#
# Fail-unsafe-to-preserve: any lookup failure (forge_pr_close_targets
# returning nothing, forge_get_issue_state failing / returning an unknown
# state) is treated as "preserve" — cleanup must never destroy a worktree it
# isn't certain is safe to remove. A skipped cleanup here is always
# recoverable later (loom-clean, or a future merge that actually closes the
# issue).
#
# The decision — close-target membership, then (only if needed) the live
# state comparison — is `loom-daemon merge-pr issue-close-gate` (Rust,
# loom-daemon/src/merge_pr/issue_close_gate.rs — #8191 slice), fed
# $close_targets on stdin. The fast-path call (no --state) answers from
# membership alone for the overwhelming common case (`Closes #N`); only when
# it answers NEED-STATE (exit 3) does this wrapper pay for the extra
# forge_get_issue_state round trip and call again with --state. Both forge
# reads stay here.
#
# A daemon that cannot decide (missing, older than this slice, or answering
# off-protocol) is warned about and resolves to PRESERVE — the same fail
# direction the original in-shell comparison already had for any lookup
# failure, now also covering "the decision could not be delegated at all".
