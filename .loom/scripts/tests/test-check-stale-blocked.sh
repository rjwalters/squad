# test-check-stale-blocked.sh - Unit tests for check-stale-blocked.sh (#8927),
# the fourth pre-wave advisory check.
#
# Mirrors test-dep-recheck-fingerprint.sh's style (a stubbed `gh` on PATH driving
# the real `loom-daemon` subcommand through the shipped stub) rather than
# test-check-quarantine-stashes.sh's, because the subject's inputs are forge
# reads, not local git state. What it pins:
#
#   (a) a STALE block   — the cited blocker has since closed/merged, in each of
#                         the three shapes dep-recheck-fingerprint.sh reads:
#                         a prose `Blocked by #N`, a `## Dependencies` checklist
#                         item, and a linked closing PR;
#   (b) an UNDOCUMENTED block — `loom:blocked` with no parseable blocker
#                         reference anywhere in body or comments (#8927's #180
#                         evidence row);
#   (c) a GENUINELY still-blocked issue — reports nothing, which is the whole
#                         reason this advisory can run on every sweep;
#   plus the advisory contract itself: always exit 0 (including with no
#   loom-daemon, no `gh`, and a forge read that fails), `--quiet` suppresses the
#   stdout one-liner, and the script never mutates a label.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-check-stale-blocked.sh
