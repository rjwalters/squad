# test-run-ci-suites-shard.sh — LOOM_CI_SHARD=k/N in run-ci-suites.sh (#9065).
#
# CI splits the wired suites across runners with LOOM_CI_SHARD. The split is
# only safe if it is COMPLETE (every suite runs in exactly one shard), if no
# bad value can quietly run nothing and exit 0 (ci-principles.md rule 6), and
# if the variable does not leak into suites the runner launches — its own
# self-tests re-invoke this runner on fixture manifests, and an inherited
# shard dropped fixture suites they expected (the first CI run of #9074).
#
# Part 1 drives the real manifest through --plan, which executes nothing.
# Part 2 runs a throwaway fixture tree, so no real suite is ever executed.
#
# Usage:
#   ./defaults/scripts/tests/test-run-ci-suites-shard.sh
