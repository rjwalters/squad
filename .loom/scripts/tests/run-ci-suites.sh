#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-ci-suites.sh — run the CI-wired shell test suites for
# defaults/scripts/tests/ (issue #4455).
#
# Runs every suite listed in ci-wired.txt CONCURRENTLY (issue #6622), each
# suite's stdout/stderr captured to its own log file exactly as before, and
# prints the pass/fail/skip report in MANIFEST order after every suite has
# finished — identical ordering and totals format to the old sequential run,
# so log diffs and the wired/excluded manifest invariant check (#4455) are
# unaffected by which suite happened to finish first. Exits non-zero if any
# wired suite fails. The wired/excluded partition invariant is enforced first
# via check-ci-suite-manifest.sh, so a fresh unlisted suite is a hard failure
# here (it cannot silently slip into an unwired pool).
#
# ## Concurrency (#6622)
#
# Suites are hermetic by construction (this job's own name) — each already
# gets its own isolated log file and its own per-suite timeout, which is what
# makes concurrent dispatch tractable without touching that machinery. Only
# the scheduling loop and the final report changed: suites are dispatched to
# a bounded worker pool (default: one worker per logical core, see
# LOOM_CI_PARALLELISM below), each writes its outcome (exit code + duration)
# to its own result file, and once every dispatched suite has completed the
# report walks the manifest array — NOT completion order — printing each
# suite's recorded outcome. The live-daemon guard (#6386) still runs
# per-suite BEFORE that suite is dispatched (not batched after the fact), so
# a guarded suite is never launched even speculatively.
#
# ## Serial lane (#6622 AC5)
#
# "Hermetic by construction" is an invariant to enforce, not an assumption to
# rely on: a suite that turns out NOT to be hermetic under concurrency is
# pinned to SERIAL_LANE_SUITES below, which runs it alone after the parallel
# pool has fully drained. See that list for the current occupants, the
# evidence that put them there, and the cost of adding one.
#
# Usage:
#   run-ci-suites.sh                 # run the whole wired set (concurrently)
#   run-ci-suites.sh --plan          # print the RUN/SKIP plan and exit (runs nothing)
#   run-ci-suites.sh --print-candidates
#                                    # print the live-daemon guard's derived pid-file
#                                    # candidate list and exit (runs nothing)
#   LOOM_CI_SUITE_TIMEOUT=180 …      # per-suite timeout in seconds (default 1200)
#   LOOM_CI_FAIL_EXCERPT_MAX=20 …    # failure-excerpt knobs — see
#   LOOM_CI_FAIL_CONTEXT_LINES=3 …     defaults/scripts/lib/ci-suite-excerpt.sh
#   LOOM_CI_FAIL_TAIL_LINES=40 …       (#6662)
#   LOOM_CI_PARALLELISM=4 …          # concurrent suites (default: logical core count)

#
# ## Live-daemon guard (#6386)
#
# The daemon-lifecycle suites (LIVE_DAEMON_GUARDED_SUITES below) execute the
# REAL loom-daemon-{start,stop,update,quiesce}.sh and loom-daemon-watchdog.sh —
# they `kill`, `rm -f` pid files, and `launchctl bootout` / `systemctl --user
# disable` whatever their invocations resolve. Every one of them sandboxes
# itself, but that is a per-case property: it takes exactly ONE case that
# forgets one pin (or one script that ignores one of them) to reach a live
# daemon. That is not hypothetical — #6386 was an Auditor running THIS script
# from a fleet host's live checkout, whose stop suite SIGTERM'd the fleet's
# authoritative dispatcher and left it down for 11 hours.
#
# So: when a daemon pid file exists on this host, those suites are SKIPPED
# (loudly, and reported in the summary), not run. CI runners have no daemon and
# no pid file, so the wired set is unaffected there — this only fires on the
# hosts where the blast radius is real. A skip is NOT a failure: the run still
# exits 0 if everything else passes, and the summary names what went
# unvalidated so the gap is never invisible.
#
# The trigger is EXISTENCE, not liveness: the lifecycle suites `rm -f`
# whichever pid file they resolve, so even a stale one is host state they must
# not silently delete (it is also the operator's evidence of how the daemon
# last exited).
#
#   LOOM_CI_ALLOW_DAEMON_SUITES=1    run them anyway (deliberate operator override)
#   LOOM_CI_DAEMON_PIDFILE_CANDIDATES=<path>[:<path>…]|none
#                                    TEST-ONLY seam: replace the derived
#                                    candidate list (`none` = no candidates at
#                                    all), so the guard's own regression suite
#                                    can assert BOTH directions regardless of
#                                    whether its host runs a real daemon. See
#                                    test-run-ci-suites-daemon-guard.sh.
#
# A manifest entry containing a `/` is a suite outside this directory,
# resolved relative to the repo root (tests/hooks/…, #4769; defaults/hooks/
# tests/…, #4451) rather than SCRIPT_DIR; its log file name has the `/`
# replaced with `_` so it stays a flat /tmp path. The default per-suite
# timeout was raised from 120s to 1200s in #4769 to cover
# tests/hooks/test-guard-destructive.sh (531 assertions, observed up to ~14
# min / 850s wall-clock on a loaded dev machine — still hermetic, just large
# — so the ceiling keeps real headroom above that peak).
#
# Exit 0 = all wired suites passed; 1 = one or more failed / manifest invalid.

# the parallel pool has fully drained. This is the escape hatch #6622's AC5
# names explicitly ("any suite that turns out not to be hermetic under
# concurrency gets fixed or explicitly pinned to a serial lane") — it is a
# quarantine list, not a general-purpose knob: adding a suite here costs its
# full wall-clock time on the critical path, so it must be justified by an
# observed concurrent-only failure, and removed once the suite is fixed.
#
# Current occupants:
#   test-loom-daemon-update.sh — failed on 2 of the 4 concurrent CI runs of
#     PR #6639 while passing every sequential run on main, and passing locally
#     both standalone and pinned to 2 oversubscribed cores. Observed failures
#     were a different assertion each time (once 2 unnamed, once test 64's
#     `--help documents --drain / --timeout / --force-after-timeout /
#     --restart-now` — an assertion with no timing component at all, which
#     rules out simple CPU-contention slowness and points at cross-suite
#     interference not yet root-caused). Tracked for a real fix rather than
#     left as a permanent pin.
#
# LOOM_CI_SERIAL_SUITES overrides the list (space-separated basenames); an
