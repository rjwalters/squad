# test-forge-check-runs-pagination.sh - Unit tests for forge_get_check_runs'
# full pagination and its fail-closed short-read contract (#8895).
#
# Bug (#8895): the GitHub branch of `forge_get_check_runs` issued ONE request
# to `GET /repos/{nwo}/commits/{sha}/check-runs` with no `per_page` and no
# `--paginate`, so GitHub's default page size of 30 applied:
#
#   $ gh api repos/rjwalters/loom/commits/c53dcaa85/check-runs \
#       --jq '"\(.total_count) \(.check_runs|length)"'
#   39 30
#
# Nine of this repo's 39 check-runs per head were therefore invisible to
# `merge-pr.sh --auto`'s settle-wait (`_wait_for_checks_then_sync_merge`) —
# invisible both to its pending count and to its failed-required
# classification. Since #8410 removed the server-side auto-merge arm, that
# settle-wait is the ONLY check-settling mechanism, which made the hidden rows
# a live "merge while CI is still unsettled" gap.
#
# The fix, in two halves — this suite pins BOTH, because either alone leaves
# the hole open:
#   1. `per_page=100` + `--paginate`: retrieve every check-run, not one page.
#   2. Fail closed when the retrieved row count is SHORT of the forge's own
#      `total_count`: return `$FORGE_CHECK_RUNS_RC_TRUNCATED` (45) and withhold
#      the partial rollup, so a future growth past any page size (or a
#      mid-pagination mutation) can never be read as settlement. Half 1 without
#      half 2 is a page-size race waiting to happen; half 2 without half 1 just
#      relocates the outage.
#
# Surfaces exercised:
#   Part 1 — the helper's pagination, with `gh` PATH-shimmed to serve page
#            fixtures (the pattern from test-merge-pr-check-runs-404-fallback.sh).
#   Part 2 — the helper's short-read fail-closed rc, plus the reads that must
#            NOT be classified as short (legitimately empty, over-reported).
#   Part 3 — `_wait_for_checks_then_sync_merge`'s loop-level handling: a
#            truncated read must never settle, and must recover when a later
#            poll comes back complete.
#   Part 4 — source-wiring assertions, so a refactor that drops `--paginate`
#            or the short-read check fails here rather than in production.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-forge-check-runs-pagination.sh

# SC2034: globals (PR_JSON, PR_NUMBER, REPO_NWO, GH, LOOM_AUTO_MERGE_*,
# LOOM_CHECK_RUNS_404_STREAK) are read only by the function extracted+sourced
# from merge-pr.sh, which shellcheck cannot see.
