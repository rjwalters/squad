# test-per-worktree-target-dir.sh — per-worktree CARGO_TARGET_DIR, wired to the
# worktree lifecycle (issue #8458, item 2 of #8453).
#
# Covers the CREATION half added to lib/cargo-target-dir.sh
# (`loom-daemon cargo-target-dir provision`) and the two attribution relaxations it
# licenses on the REMOVAL half, end to end through `worktree.sh`:
#
#   1. Opted in, on a host whose cargo output is redirected to ONE shared root:
#      the worktree gets `<root>/wt/issue-<N>`, a `.loom-cargo-target-dir` marker
#      records it, and `worktree.sh remove` reclaims it. (AC: "a removed worktree
#      leaves no build output behind".)
#   2. Two worktrees get DISTINCT dirs, so neither can execute the other's
#      uplifted `debug/loom-daemon`; removing one leaves the other's intact.
#      (AC: "two worktrees … cannot execute each other's binary".)
#   3. The reclaim still happens when the PRIMARY checkout resolves to the shared
#      root that CONTAINS the per-worktree dir — the containment relaxation. This
#      is the case that vetoed every reclaim before that relaxation existed.
#   4. The reclaim still happens when the remover's own ambient
#      CARGO_TARGET_DIR IS the per-worktree dir (what the spawn path exports) —
#      the gate-2f relaxation.
#   5. REGRESSION (#7239, the data-loss guard): with the feature ENABLED, a
#      machine-global shared root is still refused. Neither relaxation may ever
#      reach a path that lacks the per-worktree shape.
#   6. Default OFF: nothing is provisioned and nothing changes.
#   7. An unredirected host is a no-op: `<worktree>/target` is already
#      per-worktree, so no marker is written and no build cache is relocated
#      (relocating it is #6013/#6014's rebuild storm).
#   8. Idempotence: an already-per-worktree root is not nested a second level,
#      and a second `worktree.sh <N>` reuses the existing marker.
#   9. A corrupt/hostile marker degrades to "no redirect" rather than to a path
#      the reclaim would act on.
#  10. The opt-in resolves from `.loom/config.json`, not only from the env var.
#  11. merge-pr.sh's post-merge cleanup — the SECOND of the three removal paths
#      the issue names — both removes a worktree carrying the new marker (it is
#      filtered from the dirty-worktree guard) and reclaims the dir. Runs the
#      real `_remove_loom_worktree` body extracted from the live source.
#  12. The `loom-daemon cargo-target-dir` query verbs the bash library delegates
#      to — `is-attributable` and `marker` (exit code IS the answer) and
#      `path --issue <N>` (worktree root resolved in Rust, not pre-derived in
#      shell). Their contract is what the two predicates above are now made of.
#
# Harness: the throwaway-repo pattern from test-cargo-target-dir-reclaim.sh —
# bare origin + working repo, worktree.sh and its lib/ copied in, a stub `cargo`
# standing in for `cargo metadata`. Hermetic: no forge, no network, no Rust
# toolchain.
#
# ## Why the shared root here comes from $CARGO_HOME/config.toml
#
# That is the shape #8453 measured: `build.target-dir` in the HOST's
# `~/.cargo/config.toml`, so every checkout on the machine resolves to one
# directory. It is also the shape #7239 deliberately refuses to attribute to any
# single worktree — which is exactly why this feature needs its own marker, and
# why Test 5 re-asserts that the refusal survives.

# Test 12: the daemon query verbs the bash library now delegates to
#
# `lib/cargo-target-dir.sh`'s two predicates are thin wrappers over
# `loom-daemon cargo-target-dir is-attributable|marker`, and `spawn-claude.sh`
# derives its export through `path --issue <N>`. Pin the CLI contract all three
# depend on directly, so a change to the exit codes or the worktree-root
# resolution fails here rather than silently disabling a reclaim.
#
# `resolve` / `reclaim` (#9153) are pinned here too: they are merge-pr.sh's
# post-merge removal pair, and their contract is what makes that call site
# degradable — BOTH must exit 0 for every not-applicable case, and `reclaim`
# must stay silent for the un-redirected layout rather than emitting a record
# the shell would replay as a bogus INFO line.
