# verdict-staleness-guard.sh — bind a PR's review verdict to the tree it was
# rendered against, and invalidate it when the head SHA moves (issue #5686).
#
# Problem this closes: a review verdict (`loom:changes-requested`, or the more
# dangerous approving `loom:pr`) is a statement about a SPECIFIC TREE. Before
# this guard, the label outlived the tree — a force-push/rebase could replace
# every commit the verdict was written about and the label would sit there
# unchanged. Observed live on rjwalters/repo#192 (2026-08-08): Judge correctly
# requested changes for a genuinely-failing test at 02:22, the branch was
# rebased and force-pushed at 02:55 making CI green, and the PR then sat with
# `loom:changes-requested` and no Judge re-queue until an operator cleared the
# label by hand. The inverse direction is worse: a `loom:pr` approval that
# survives a force-push lets Champion auto-merge a tree nobody approved.
#
# The fix is a marker, not a new label. Every terminal verdict comment carries
#
#     <!-- loom:verdict-sha sha=<head-sha> verdict=approved|changes-requested -->
#
# (the same HTML-comment marker convention as `<!-- loom:standdown claim=... -->`
# and `<!-- loom:fallback-evaluated sha=... -->`), so the verdict records which
# tree it covers. This script compares that recorded SHA against the PR's
# CURRENT head SHA and reports FRESH / STALE, optionally performing the
# clear+re-queue transition itself.
#
# Decision, in priority order (first match wins):
#   1. NOT_OPEN     — the PR is no longer open (merged, or closed unmerged).
#                     A verdict is a statement about a tree someone might still
#                     act on; once the PR is finished there is nothing left to
#                     invalidate or re-queue. The guard reports and does
#                     NOTHING — no labels, no comment — whatever the marker
#                     says (#6781).
#   2. NO_VERDICT   — the PR carries neither `loom:pr` nor
#                     `loom:changes-requested`. Nothing to invalidate.
#   3. UNVERIFIABLE — a verdict label is present, but no marker comment exists
#                     for THAT verdict kind. Fail safe: the verdict is kept.
#                     This is the pre-migration/rollout case (verdicts written
#                     before this guard shipped carry no marker), the
#                     mixed-fleet case (a host still running the older prompt),
#                     and — most commonly in practice — the case where the
#                     model simply dropped the marker (#6319: observed on
#                     roughly one verdict in four). Never force-clear on
#                     missing evidence; with --anchor, remediate instead (#3b).
#  3b. ANCHORED      — --anchor was passed and the UNVERIFIABLE verdict was
#                     given a marker recording the CURRENT head, so it becomes
#                     invalidatable from here on (#6319).
#   4. FRESH        — the newest matching marker's SHA equals the current head
#                     SHA. The verdict still describes the tree in front of it.
#   5. STALE        — the newest matching marker's SHA differs from the current
#                     head SHA. The verdict describes a tree that no longer
#                     exists; it must not be trusted.
#
# NOT_OPEN is first for a reason (#6781). A merge that lands between a caller's
# read and this check is the ordinary "completed externally (daemon/champion)"
# race (#4884), and a merged PR's head SHA routinely differs from the SHA its
# approval was rendered against (a last commit, a rebase, or the merge itself).
# Without the state check the guard reads that difference as STALE and, with
# --clear, strips `loom:pr` and re-adds `loom:review-requested` on a PR that is
# already merged — observed live on PR #6772 (2026-08-23). Every consumer of
# `loom:review-requested` filters on state==OPEN today, so nothing acted on it,
# but the guard was writing verdict labels onto finished work.
#
# Marker selection deliberately filters on `verdict=` (not just "the newest
# marker of any kind"): a PR that was rejected at SHA A and later approved at
# SHA B has markers for both, and only the one matching the CURRENTLY-HELD
# label says anything about the current verdict. A verdict label with no
# marker of its own kind is UNVERIFIABLE, not STALE — see #2 above.
#
# Any head-SHA change invalidates the verdict — there is deliberately NO
# force-push-vs-fast-forward detector here. For a statement about a tree, an
# appended commit is just as much "not the tree I reviewed" as a rebase is,
# and the extra machinery would not change a single answer (#5686 explicitly
# scopes it out).
#
# Usage:
#   verdict-staleness-guard.sh <pr-number>            # report only
#   verdict-staleness-guard.sh <pr-number> --clear     # report + act on STALE
#   verdict-staleness-guard.sh <pr-number> --anchor    # report + act on UNVERIFIABLE
#
# With --clear, a STALE verdict is cleared in one transition:
#   - remove BOTH terminal verdict labels (`loom:pr` AND `loom:changes-requested`),
#     not just the one detected as stale — a stray copy of the other, left
#     behind by an earlier contradictory state or a manual label edit, must
#     not survive this transition either (#7018). `gh ... --remove-label` on a
#     label that isn't present is a no-op, so requesting removal of both is
#     always safe.
#   - remove its per-tree companions (`loom:ci-failure`, `loom:merge-conflict`)
#     when present — those are findings about the OLD tree too
#   - add `loom:review-requested` so a Judge picks the PR up again
#   - post an auditable comment naming the old and new SHAs
#   - DISARM the forge's server-side auto-merge queue if one is armed (#8900)
#
# The disarm (#8900) is not optional politeness — without it the label flip is
# cosmetic. An armed GitHub auto-merge is gated ONLY by the branch ruleset's
# REQUIRED checks: it never re-reads `loom:pr`, never notices this very
# clearing, never waits for a non-required suite, and never runs merge-pr.sh's
# own merge-time gates (including the #8248 required-check freshness guard,
# which lives inside that script). So a PR whose verdict this guard had just
# invalidated still merged, unreviewed, the moment required checks went green on
# the new head: #8694 merged as 528f2971 on 2026-09-25, three minutes after a
# Doctor rebase force-push, still labeled `loom:review-requested`, with no
# approval at the merged head; #8847 and #8843 merged ~2 minutes after
# `gh pr update-branch` moved their heads.
#
# THE DISARM IS NOT IMPLEMENTED HERE. It is one call to
# `loom-daemon forge disable-auto-merge <pr> --audit-comment --hold <label>`,
# which reads the arm state, sends `disablePullRequestAutoMerge` only when
# something is actually armed, and posts its own audit comment recording what it
# did (silent when nothing was armed). The first draft of #8900 mirrored that
# mutation inline here in `gh api graphql` plus two comment bodies; review
# rejected it (PR #8990) as exactly the new portable shell
# `.loom/docs/shell-language-policy.md` forbids — new executable logic is a
# loom-daemon subcommand — and the shell-budget ratchet refused the PR outright.
# Do NOT reintroduce an inline mutation "as a fallback for hosts without
# loom-daemon": that duplication is the thing that was rejected. A host that
# cannot resolve the binary gets AUTO_MERGE_DISARMED=0 and a named failure in
# REASON, which is loud, plus the daemon's own periodic
# `claim_reconciliation` backstop for the non-held cases.
#
# The disarm runs BEFORE the comment and the label flip. That is the safest of
# the three possible orders: disarming can only PREVENT a merge, never cause
# one, so going first shrinks the window in which the queued merge could still
# fire, and a later comment/label failure leaves the PR disarmed with its
# verdict intact — strictly safer than the pre-#8900 behavior either way.
#
# With --anchor, an UNVERIFIABLE verdict is remediated rather than merely
# reported (#6319): the guard posts a comment carrying the marker the verdict
# should have had, recording the head SHA as of NOW.
#
# The marker is prose-compliance, not a mechanism — judge.md ASKS the model to
# append it at every one of ~19 verdict-write sites, and production dropped it
# on roughly one verdict in four. Every dropped marker silently reinstates the
# pre-#5686 hazard for the life of the label: the approval survives any
# force-push undetected and Champion may auto-merge a tree nobody approved.
# Anchoring bounds that exposure to one pass instead of forever.
#
# Anchoring is deliberately NOT a verdict:
#   - It writes NO labels. The verdict label was already there and stays
#     exactly as it was, so anchoring cannot approve, reject, or un-park
#     anything — the only state it changes is "this verdict can now be
#     checked". It is therefore safe in a way --clear is not.
#   - It cannot reconstruct which tree was actually reviewed. If the head
#     already moved before the anchor, the verdict is anchored to a tree that
#     may never have been reviewed. Anchoring bounds FUTURE exposure only, and
#     is a backstop for judge.md's marker, never a substitute for it.
#   - It is idempotent: the marker it posts is exactly what step 3 scans for,
#     so the next run reads FRESH and never anchors twice.
#   - It is suppressed on a hold label, like --clear (see below): a PR a human
#     deliberately parked should not collect automated comments either.
#
# --clear is suppressed (DECISION stays STALE, CLEARED=0) when the PR carries
# an explicit hold label — `loom:blocked`, `loom:operator`, or
# `loom:operator-only`. Those mark a PR a human (or Champion's capped-PR
# recovery pass) deliberately took out of automated flow; silently re-queueing
# it for review would undo that decision. Callers must still treat the verdict
# as untrustworthy: STALE is STALE whether or not it was cleared.
#
# The #8900 auto-merge disarm is deliberately NOT suppressed by a hold label.
# Every other write this guard makes could undo an operator's decision; the
# disarm is the one that ENFORCES it. A held PR with an armed auto-merge merges
# anyway the moment required checks pass — `loom:operator` means "the engine
# stops acting", and Champion's merge-risk hold applies it specifically to stop
# a merge, so leaving the forge's own queue armed defeats the hold entirely.
# Disarming can only prevent a merge, so it cannot be the write that undoes a
# hold. `--hold "$HOLD_LABEL"` is passed through to the subcommand so its audit
# comment can say why a parked PR was written to at all; a held PR with nothing
# armed still collects no comment and no write, exactly as before.

Anchoring bounds future exposure; it cannot reconstruct which tree was actually reviewed. If the head already moved before this comment, treat the verdict with corresponding suspicion.

No version floor is declared on purpose: every other write this guard makes is unaffected, so refusing the whole stale-verdict clear over a missing disarm would trade the #5686 hazard back for the #8900 one (#8900/#8990).

**Stale review verdict cleared — head SHA moved**

This PR's \`$VERDICT_LABEL\` verdict was rendered against \`$MARKER_SHA\`, but the current head is \`$HEAD_SHA\`. A review verdict is a statement about a specific tree, so it does not survive a rebase, a force-push, or new commits.

- Verdict cleared: \`$VERDICT_LABEL\` (recorded for \`$MARKER_SHA\`)
- Returned to the review queue: \`loom:review-requested\` (current head \`$HEAD_SHA\`)

Judge will re-evaluate the tree that is actually here now. No judgment about the new tree is implied either way — the old verdict simply no longer describes it.
