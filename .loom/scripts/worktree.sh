# Loom Worktree Helper Script
# Safely creates and manages git worktrees for agent development
#
# Usage:
#   pnpm worktree <issue-number>                       # Create worktree for issue
#   pnpm worktree <issue-number> <branch>              # Create worktree with custom branch name
#   pnpm worktree <issue-number> --sparse <paths...>   # Cone-mode sparse checkout
#   pnpm worktree <issue-number> --full                # Convert sparse worktree to full
#   pnpm worktree remove <issue-number> [--keep-branch] [--force] [--dry-run]
#     # Remove one managed worktree (--dry-run reports the plan, including any
#     # reclaimable redirected cargo target dir + its size, and changes nothing)
#   pnpm worktree snapshot <issue-number> [--include-untracked] [--json]
#     # Write a patch file capturing the worktree's uncommitted diff to
#     # <worktree-root>/.snapshots/issue-<N>-<UTC-timestamp>.patch — WITHOUT
#     # touching `git stash` (which is repo-global and can be clobbered by a
#     # concurrent builder in another worktree). Replay with `git apply`.
#   pnpm worktree stash-push <issue-number|main> [--include-untracked] [--json]
#   pnpm worktree stash-pop <issue-number|main> [--json]
#     # Clean-and-restore pair for a "clean baseline vs my diff" comparison
#     # (clippy/shellcheck/test baseline diffing) — WITHOUT touching the
#     # shared `refs/stash` stack. Anchors captured WIP to a PER-TARGET ref
#     # (refs/loom/stash-baseline/issue-<N>, or .../main for the primary
#     # clone) instead, so no other worktree's concurrent stash op can ever
#     # land "in between" push and pop (#5217, extended to `main` by #6076).
#   pnpm worktree --check                              # Check if currently in a worktree
#   pnpm worktree --json <issue-number>                # Machine-readable output
#   pnpm worktree --return-to <dir> <issue-number>     # Store return directory
#   pnpm worktree --help                               # Show help

# `_worktree_branch_fully_captured`). Sourced defensively with a fail-closed

# Loom-managed sentinel (issue #3548)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Write the `.loom-managed` marker that authorizes cleanup tooling
# (merge-pr.sh, agent-destroy.sh, loom-clean) to remove this worktree. A
# worktree lacking this file is treated as user-owned and never touched by
# Loom (see issue #3334).
#
# This MUST be called on every code path that leaves a usable Loom worktree
# behind — not just first-creation. Historically the write lived inline in the
# `_try_worktree_add` success block only, so any re-invocation against an
# existing worktree (preserve-work, stale-reset, --sparse/--full re-config)
# exited before writing the sentinel and stranded the worktree: merge-pr.sh
# then refused to clean it up. See issue #3548.
#
# The write is a plain overwrite (`>`), so it is idempotent and self-heals a
# worktree whose sentinel was deleted. It reads the global $ISSUE_NUMBER and
# $BRANCH_NAME at call time. Do NOT call this for directories that are not
# registered git worktrees (the orphan-debris case) — those must be left
# sentinel-less so cleanup tooling keeps refusing them.

# Concurrency lock (issue #3380)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `git worktree add` is not safe to run concurrently against the same repo —
# parallel invocations contend on the per-worktree administrative dir
# (`.git/worktrees/issue-N/`) and on git's repo-global locks. The observed
# failure mode in busy shepherd sessions is multi-minute hangs (10-20 min)
# while a peer process holds an `index.lock` it will never release.
#
# We use a POSIX-atomic `mkdir`-based lock primitive — `flock` is not
# available on stock macOS, so `mkdir` is the only portable atomic
# file-system operation we can rely on.
#
# Lock scope is **repo-global** (`.loom/locks/worktree-add/`). The original
# per-issue design was tried first but failed under concurrent invocations
# with different issue numbers: `git worktree add` mutates the repo-global
# `.git/config.lock` (writing the new branch's upstream configuration), and
# concurrent processes race with the diagnostic:
#
#   error: could not lock config file .git/config: File exists
#   error: unable to write upstream branch configuration
#
# A repo-global lock serializes the entire `git worktree add` call so this
# race cannot happen. The cost — two builders on different issues no longer
# parallelize through the helper for the (short) duration of `git worktree
# add` itself — is acceptable because (a) `git worktree add` itself is short
# relative to the rest of an issue's lifecycle, and (b) parallel hangs that
# hold an `index.lock` for 10-20 minutes are the very problem this PR fixes.
#
# The lock path uses the same name (`worktree-<id>/`) the per-issue version
# used so its layout matches `.loom/locks/issue-<N>/`. The "id"
# here is the constant string "add"; per-issue accounting still lives in the
# `owner.json` body for debugging visibility.
#
# **Critical-section scope (issue #6014):** the lock is held across the
# `git worktree add` invocation itself (plus its short recovery retry) and
# the repo-level git preparation that immediately precedes it and must not
# race with a concurrent add — `git worktree prune`, the `git fetch` of
# `origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH` / the base branch / `origin/feature/issue-N`, and
# base-branch resolution. It is explicitly NOT held across anything that
# follows the add: sentinel writing, sparse-checkout setup, submodule init,
# or the project-specific `post-worktree.sh` hook. The call site releases the
# lock the moment `git worktree add` returns, success or failure, rather than
# waiting for the script's EXIT trap. A repo whose post-worktree hook can run
# for minutes (e.g. a `cargo build --release`) must not serialize every
# *unrelated* worktree creation on the host behind it — the post-add phase
# does not touch `.git/config.lock` at all, so it needs no repo-global
# serialization.
#
# **Ownership verification (issue #6014):** each acquisition writes a random
# one-shot `token` into `owner.json` alongside `owner_pid`, and
# `acquire_worktree_lock` returns it via the `WORKTREE_LOCK_TOKEN` global.
# `release_worktree_lock` requires the caller to pass that same token back
# and refuses to remove the lock directory unless the token it finds on disk
# still matches — so a late release from a stale/wedged holder (e.g. its
# EXIT trap finally firing well after an operator judged it dead, manually
# cleared the lock, and a different process legitimately re-acquired it)
# is a safe no-op instead of deleting a live holder's lock out from under it.

# Removes the residue of a crashed `git worktree add`:

#     that git would normally hold for the duration of an add operation and
#     release on success/failure. A SIGKILL'd or stuck process leaves them
#     behind, where they block every subsequent operation against the same
#     administrative dir.
#   - `.loom/worktrees/issue-<N>/` — a half-created worktree dir that was
#     never registered with git (verified via `git worktree list --porcelain`).
#
# **Sentinel contract** (#3334): a dir that IS registered with git is NEVER
# removed by this helper, regardless of `.loom-managed` presence. The sentinel
# governs cleanup-on-merge; this helper governs cleanup-on-crash-recovery, and
# the dividing line is "registered with git or not". An unregistered dir is by
# definition a shell from a killed add — the sentinel is written *after* a
# successful add, so a half-created dir never has one.
#
# Ported to `loom-daemon worktree-cleanup` (#8195 slice 5, epic #7810). The
# whole body — the lock sweep, the orphan guard's registered/not decision, the
# `rm -rf` it gates and the conditional prune — now lives in
# `loom-daemon/src/worktree_cli/cleanup.rs` with the design rationale it used
# to carry inline.
#
# WHY THIS FAMILY. Step 2 is the single most dangerous predicate in this file:
# a guard whose FALSE answer runs `rm -rf` on a directory that may hold another
# agent's uncommitted work — and it has answered falsely on a live worktree
# twice over (#7858/#7849), once because `awk '{print $2}'` truncates a
# porcelain path at its first space and once because the candidate was resolved
# logically rather than physically. Both halves are structural in Rust: the
# path is `line.strip_prefix("worktree ")` with nothing to word-split (and it
# is now literally `branch_delete::parse_worktree_porcelain`, the reader slice
# 3 already uses, rather than the "mirrors …" copy this comment used to admit
# to), and the candidate goes through `fs::canonicalize`, which has no logical
# variant to forget.
#
# THE CONTRACT THIS STUB PRESERVES, verbatim: the two warning texts and the
# order they print in, silence under --json (fd 1 is already stderr there, so
# `--quiet` suppresses rather than reroutes), and return 0 on every path.
#
# NO DAEMON MEANS NO CLEANUP, deliberately — this sits on the ALWAYS-TAKEN
# create path, where a hard dependency is exactly what got slice 1's lock
# delegation reverted (#8226). That degradation is honest rather than merely
# convenient because of its DIRECTION: a stale lock left in place makes `git
# worktree add` fail with git's own lock error, and an orphan dir left in place
# makes this script exit 1 with "Directory exists but is not a registered
# worktree", naming the `rm -rf` to run. Both are loud, non-destructive
# refusals — the pre-#3416 behaviour this cleanup was added to spare an
# operator. The DANGEROUS direction (deleting a live worktree) is unreachable
# when the code does not run at all, which is why this warns nothing and exits
# 0 rather than refusing the way the `remove`/`wip` verbs do at
# LOOM_SCRIPT_HELPER_MISSING_RC=2: there, a silent skip could be mistaken for a
# completed destructive operation; here there is nothing to mistake.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Ported to `loom-daemon worktree-remove` (#8195 slice 3, epic #7810). The verb
# every irreversible operation in this script was reachable from — the eight
# guards, `git worktree remove --force`, the #5177 direct `rm -rf` fallback,
# the #7239 cargo-target-dir reclaim, the #5950 ledger write and the
# squash-aware `git branch -D` — now lives in
# `loom-daemon/src/worktree_cli/{remove,branch_delete,branch_landed,default_branch}.rs`,
# along with the full design rationale it used to carry inline.
#
# The contract this entry point preserves, verbatim: the verb names
# (`remove`/`--remove`), the flags (`--keep-branch`, `--force|-f`,
# `--dry-run|-n`, `--json`), exit 0 for a removal AND for the idempotent
# "nothing there" no-op AND for every `--dry-run`, exit 1 for a refusal or a
# failed removal, the `--json` document's field set, and the `.loom-managed`
# sentinel contract (only sentinel-bearing worktrees are ever removed).
# `CLAUDE.md`, `builder-worktree.md` and `defaults/docs/troubleshooting.md` all
# name this by path, and operators chain it with `&&`.
#
# Three helpers went with it and are NOT re-implemented here: the dirty-line
# filter (now `worktree_ops::safety::is_loom_own_untracked_path`, shared with
# the daemon's own reclaim path since #8279), the attached-branch porcelain
# parse, and — most importantly — the `awk`-extract-and-`eval` of
# `_maybe_delete_local_branch` out of the live `merge-pr.sh` source. That
# contraption existed only because bash has no import mechanism; Rust does, so
# `merge-pr.sh`'s own port (#8191) can import the rule instead of the script
# re-deriving it at runtime. Until then the two are pinned to each other by a
# test that greps `merge-pr.sh` for every message string.
#
# LOOM_SCRIPT_HELPER_MISSING_RC=2 — argued, not defaulted:
#
#   0 and 1 are both ANSWERS here, and they are the two answers an operator
#   acts on destructively. 0 means "that worktree is gone (or was never
#   there)"; 1 means "I looked and refused, nothing was deleted". An
#   unresolvable binary is neither, and it must never be mistaken for either:
#   read as 0, a caller proceeds as though a worktree with uncommitted work had
#   been safely removed; read as 1, it looks like a considered refusal that an
#   operator may then override with --force. 2 is the code every other
#   epic-#7810 stub reserves for "could not run at all", so an operator reading
#   an exit code gets one consistent answer across all of them.
#
# The missing-library case takes the same code, deliberately NOT left to
# `set -e`: a failed `source` under `set -e` aborts with 1, which is the
# REFUSAL code, so a partially-resynced `.loom/` would present as "I considered
# your worktree and declined" rather than "this install is broken".

# WIP-shelving verbs: snapshot / stash-push / stash-pop
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Ported to `loom-daemon worktree-wip` (#8195 slice 2, epic #7810). The three
# verbs that shelve a tree's uncommitted work — and, for `stash-push`, run
# `git reset --hard HEAD` once the capture has succeeded — now live in
# `loom-daemon/src/worktree_cli/{snapshot,baseline,wip}.rs`, where the full
# design rationale they used to carry inline also moved.
#
# The contract this entry point preserves, verbatim: the verb names and their
# flags, `<issue-number>` (plus the literal `main` for the stash pair), exit 0
# for success INCLUDING the legitimate no-ops, exit 1 for a refusal, and the
# `--json` stdout-purity split. Role prompts (`builder.md`,
# `builder-worktree.md`, `doctor.md`), `defaults/docs/guard-hooks.md` and the
# `stash-scope` guard's own deny message all name these by path.
#
# LOOM_SCRIPT_HELPER_MISSING_RC=2 — argued, not defaulted:
#
#   These verbs already use 0 and 1 as ANSWERS. 0 means "your work is captured"
#   (`stash-push`) or "your work is back" (`stash-pop`); 1 means "I refused and
#   changed nothing". Leaving the helper's default of 1 would make an
#   unresolvable binary indistinguishable from a refusal — survivable — but
#   there is no code left that could mean "could not run", and the two failures
#   want opposite handling: a refusal is a fact about your tree, an unresolvable
#   binary is a fact about the host. 2 is the code every other epic-#7810 stub
#   reserves for exactly that, so an operator reading an exit code gets one
#   consistent answer across all of them.
#
#   What must NEVER happen is exit 0. A caller that read "captured" from a
#   binary that never ran would go on to `git reset --hard` nothing, run its
#   baseline check against an uncleaned tree, and then `stash-pop` a capture
#   that does not exist. `loom_exec_script_helper` only ever `exec`s or exits
#   non-zero, so that outcome is unreachable by construction rather than by
#   convention.
#
# The missing-library case is handled the same way, and deliberately NOT left
# to `set -e`: a `source` that fails under `set -e` aborts with 1, which is the
# REFUSAL code, so a partially-resynced `.loom/` would present as "the verb
# considered your tree and declined" rather than "this install is broken". The
# explicit check below reports 2 instead — the one thing the exit codes must
# never do is lie about which of those happened.

                                                        (--dry-run: report the plan only)
  pnpm worktree snapshot <N> [--include-untracked] [--json]

Examples:
  pnpm worktree 42
    Creates: .loom/worktrees/issue-42
    Branch: feature/issue-42

  pnpm worktree 42 fix-bug
    Creates: .loom/worktrees/issue-42
    Branch: feature/fix-bug

  pnpm worktree 42 --base feature/issue-41
    Creates: .loom/worktrees/issue-42
    Branch: feature/issue-42, branched off feature/issue-41 instead of the
    default branch (stacked-PR mode, #3729). Used by /loom:sweep --depends-on.

  pnpm worktree 42 --sparse src/lib defaults/scripts
    Creates a sparse worktree containing only the listed paths plus the
    always-included safety set (.claude/, .loom/, .githooks/, scripts/, and
    all tracked top-level files).

  pnpm worktree 42 --full
    Converts an existing sparse worktree back to a full checkout
    (no-op on an already-full worktree).

  pnpm worktree remove 42
    Removes the managed worktree .loom/worktrees/issue-42 and deletes its local
    branch (safe delete — refuses on unmerged commits). This is the sanctioned
    single-worktree removal path so you never need 'git worktree remove'
    directly. It honors the .loom-managed sentinel (refuses to remove a
    user-provisioned worktree), REFUSES when the worktree has uncommitted
    changes (#4449 — see --force below), is idempotent (clear no-op if absent),
    and prunes the git worktree registration. Use 'loom-clean' for bulk/stale
    cleanup across all closed issues.

  pnpm worktree remove 42 --keep-branch
    Same as above but leaves the local feature branch intact.

  pnpm worktree remove 42 --force
    Removes the worktree even when it has uncommitted changes, DISCARDING them.
    Without --force, a dirty worktree makes 'remove' exit non-zero, list what it
    found, and print how to preserve the work (commit / save a patch / stash).
    Loom runtime markers (.loom-managed, .loom-in-use, .loom-checkpoint,
    .no-changes-needed) never count as uncommitted work.

  pnpm worktree snapshot 42
    Writes the worktree's uncommitted diff (tracked-file changes: staged +
    unstaged, via 'git diff HEAD') to a patch file at:
      <worktree-root>/.snapshots/issue-42-<UTC-timestamp>.patch
    Does NOT touch 'git stash' — unlike stash, which is repo-global across
    every worktree in the repo, this patch file is scoped to this one
    invocation and this one path, so concurrent snapshots from other
    'issue-<N>' worktrees can never collide or clobber each other. Replay
    into a fresh worktree for the same issue with:
      git -C .loom/worktrees/issue-42 apply <patch-path>
    A worktree with no uncommitted changes still succeeds, writing an empty
    patch file rather than erroring.

  pnpm worktree snapshot 42 --include-untracked
    Same as above, but also folds untracked files into the patch (via a
    temporary 'git add -N' intent-to-add that is reverted immediately after
    the diff is captured — the worktree's index ends unchanged). Loom runtime
    markers are excluded even with this flag.

  pnpm worktree snapshot 42 --json
    Output: {"success": true, "issueNumber": 42, "patchPath": "/path/to/.snapshots/issue-42-...patch", "hasChanges": true, "bytes": 1234}

  pnpm worktree stash-push 42
    For a "clean baseline vs my diff" comparison (clippy/shellcheck/test
    baseline diffing, issue #5217): captures the worktree's uncommitted
    tracked-file diff via 'git stash create' (never touches refs/stash),
    anchors it under the PER-ISSUE ref refs/loom/stash-baseline/issue-42, and
    resets the worktree to a clean 'git reset --hard HEAD' baseline. Unlike
    raw 'git stash push', two builders in different worktrees can never
    collide — each issue gets its own ref, not a shared stack — so this does
    NOT trigger guard-destructive-generic.sh's stash-scope:worktree-collision
    ask even with several other '.loom-managed' worktrees active.

  pnpm worktree stash-push 42 --include-untracked
    Same as above, but also moves untracked files (respecting .gitignore,
    excluding Loom runtime markers) into a per-issue holding directory
    instead of leaving them in the worktree.

  pnpm worktree stash-pop 42
    Restores whatever 'stash-push 42' captured (tracked diff + any moved
    untracked files) and clears the ref / holding directory. Succeeds as a
    no-op when the matching stash-push found an already-clean worktree, so
    'stash-push 42 && <baseline check> && stash-pop 42' never breaks its own
    chain. Errors loudly, WITHOUT discarding the captured baseline, if no
    stash-push is pending at all or if re-applying conflicts with the tree.

  pnpm worktree stash-push main / stash-pop main
    Same clean-and-restore pair, but for the PRIMARY CLONE, anchored to
    refs/loom/stash-baseline/main (#6076). This is what a role that
    legitimately runs in the main checkout (Judge, Champion, Auditor, Guide,
    Hermit) should use instead of raw 'git stash' + 'git stash pop' there:
    the main checkout's refs/stash stack is operator-owned, and a raw pop in
    it is an unanswerable stash-scope:main-checkout ask in a headless run.
    Never touches refs/stash, so it needs no guard bypass.

  pnpm worktree stash-push 42 --json / stash-pop 42 --json
    Output: {"success": true, "issueNumber": 42, "target": "42", "hasTrackedChanges": true, "untrackedCount": 0, "ref": "refs/loom/stash-baseline/issue-42"}
            {"success": true, "issueNumber": 42, "target": "42", "restoredTracked": true, "restoredUntrackedCount": 0}
    For 'main', issueNumber is null and target is "main".

  pnpm worktree --check
    Shows current worktree status

  pnpm worktree --json 42
    Output: {"success": true, "worktreePath": "/path/to/.loom/worktrees/issue-42", ...}

  pnpm worktree --return-to $(pwd) 42
    Creates worktree and stores current directory for later return

Sparse-Mode Notes:
  - --sparse and --full are mutually exclusive
  - --sparse requires at least one path
  - Re-running --sparse with the same cone is a clean no-op (idempotent)
  - Re-running --sparse with a different cone replaces the cone
  - Set LOOM_WORKTREE_ALWAYS_INCLUDE to add repo-specific safety paths

Safety Features:
  ✓ Detects if already in a worktree
  ✓ Uses sandbox-safe path (.loom/worktrees/)
  ✓ Pulls latest origin/main before creating worktree
  ✓ Automatically creates branch from main
  ✓ Prevents nested worktrees
  ✓ Non-interactive (safe for AI agents)
  ✓ Reuses existing branches automatically
  ✓ Symlinks node_modules from main (avoids pnpm install)
  ✓ Symlinks nested per-package node_modules for pnpm/monorepo workspaces
  ✓ Symlinks extra gitignored paths via .loom/config.json worktree.linkPaths
  ✓ Excludes created symlinks via .git/info/exclude (no accidental git add)
  ✓ Symlinks .mcp.json from main (MCP config visible in worktrees)
  ✓ Runs project-specific hooks after creation
  ✓ Stashes/restores local changes during pull
  ✓ Repo-global lock serializes concurrent invocations (issue #3380)
  ✓ Recovers from stale .git/worktrees/issue-N/index.lock files
  ✓ Recovers from half-created .loom/worktrees/issue-N/ dirs

Environment Variables:
  LOOM_WORKTREE_ALWAYS_INCLUDE      Extra sparse-mode safety paths (space-sep)
  LOOM_SUBMODULE_TIMEOUT            Per-submodule init timeout (default 300s)
  LOOM_WORKTREE_LOCK_TIMEOUT        Lock acquisition timeout in seconds
                                    (default 600 — covers the pre-add git
                                    prep (prune/fetch) plus 'git worktree
                                    add' itself; the lock is released as soon
                                    as the add returns, before sentinel
                                    writing, submodule init or the
                                    post-worktree hook run)
  LOOM_WORKTREE_LOCK_POLL_INTERVAL  Lock poll interval in seconds (default 2)
  LOOM_PRESERVE_WORKTREE            Disable cleanup-on-merge for all worktrees

Project-Specific Hooks:
  Create .loom/hooks/post-worktree.sh to run custom setup after worktree creation.
  This file is NOT overwritten by Loom upgrades.

  Declaring a repo-owned file under .loom/hooks/: no manifest entry, naming
  convention, or sentinel is required. Every uninstall/reinstall path
  (including a --clean reinstall) computes its removal candidates from Loom's
  own defaults/hooks/ -- per-repo .loom/hooks/ copies are outside that
  ownership boundary entirely (Epic #3835 Phase 5, #4262: hooks execute from
  the machine-level checkout, not the per-repo copy), so nothing under
  .loom/hooks/ is ever swept as "unmanaged" on uninstall, whatever its name.
  This is enforced, not just documented (issue #5971) -- a real consumer
  incident lost a repo-owned .loom/hooks/post-worktree.sh to a --clean
  reinstall before the fix. A fresh --quick install still COPIES the
  current defaults/hooks/*.sh names into .loom/hooks/ (install_hooks_and_cli)
  -- an existing file there is preserved unless the install explicitly forces
  an overwrite (--clean / --force), matching a same-named Loom-shipped hook.

  The hook receives three arguments:
    \$1 - Absolute path to the new worktree
    \$2 - Branch name (e.g., feature/issue-42)
    \$3 - Issue number

  Example hook (.loom/hooks/post-worktree.sh):
    #!/bin/bash
    cd "\$1"
    pnpm install  # or: lake exe cache get, pip install -e ., etc.

Monorepo / Generated-Artifact Symlinks:
  In addition to the root node_modules symlink, worktree.sh symlinks:
    - Nested per-package node_modules (e.g. apps/web/node_modules) discovered by
      scanning the main workspace for node_modules dirs that sit next to a
      package.json (pnpm/monorepo layouts). No YAML parser dependency.
    - Extra gitignored paths listed in .loom/config.json under worktree.linkPaths,
      e.g. generated wasm-pack bindings that are expensive to rebuild per worktree:

        { "worktree": { "linkPaths": ["apps/web/src/wasm"] } }

  Each created symlink is added to the worktree's .git/info/exclude so 'git add -A'
  never stages it. All symlinking is best-effort — a failed link warns and
  continues; it never aborts worktree creation. Repos with no nested node_modules
  and no worktree.linkPaths config see no behavior change.

Resuming Abandoned Work:
  If an agent abandoned work on issue #42, a new agent can resume:
    ./.loom/scripts/worktree.sh 42
  This will:
    - Reuse the existing feature/issue-42 branch
    - Create a fresh worktree at .loom/worktrees/issue-42
    - Allow continuing from where the previous agent left off

Notes:
  - All worktrees are created in .loom/worktrees/ (gitignored)
  - Branch names automatically prefixed with 'feature/'
  - Existing branches are reused without prompting (non-interactive)
  - After creation, cd into the worktree to start working
  - To return to main: cd /path/to/repo && git checkout main

# --- Lease this claim's liveness (#8193) -------------------------------------
# An in-session Task-tool Builder claims `loom:building` and then publishes no
# liveness record of any kind: `SweepRegistry::dispatch` never ran for it, so
# there is no journal entry and no `write_lease_comment` (#6179), and the
# in-session publish step lives in the SWEEP orchestrator's prompt, not the
# builder's. `claim_reconciliation`'s Phase-2 gate (#6286) then reads
# `lease_evidence=absent` and reclaims a claim that is actively being worked --
# three such reclaims on one six-builder wave, 2026-09-17.
#
# Here, rather than in `builder.md`, for the reason #7672 established: a
# prose-mandated lease step was skipped by exactly one session and cost ~2.5h of
# fleet claim/yield thrash. Every builder already runs this script immediately
# after claiming, so this is the one call site that cannot be forgotten. It sits
# at pre-flight (before the create/reuse branch below) so it covers every way
# this script can conclude, which is also `sweep-lease-publish.sh`'s own
# documented publish-at-pre-flight semantics.
#
# `--watch-pid` is `${CLAUDE_PID:-$PPID}` and NEVER `$$`: `$$` is the one-shot
# tool-call subshell, which exits the instant the call returns, so the renewal
# loop would self-terminate on its first wake-up. The remaining policy -- the
# no-op when the daemon already published (#7672), the refusal outside an agent
# session, the 4h renewal cap -- lives in `loom-daemon lease ensure`, per
# ADR-0018 and because this file's `contract` category admits no growth.

    #
    # Ported to `loom-daemon worktree-link` (#8195 slice 4, epic #7810). The
    # four link families — root node_modules, nested per-package node_modules
    # for pnpm/monorepo layouts (#3528), `worktree.linkPaths` from the config
    # tier chain (#4062) and `.mcp.json` — plus the idempotent info/exclude
    # bookkeeping that keeps `git add -A` from staging any of them (#5474),
    # now live in `loom-daemon/src/worktree_cli/link.rs` with the full design
    # rationale they used to carry inline.
    #
    # This family, and not another arm of the create path, because it is the
    # one that is ALL path interpolation: four `ln -s "$src" "$dst"` pairs, a
    # `find -print0 | read -r -d ''` loop, a `${pkg_dir#"$prefix"/}` strip and
    # a `grep -qxF "$entry" "$file"`. That is #7858's class — an unquoted path
    # that turned a guard into an `rm -rf` on a live worktree — and in Rust a
    # path is an OsString that `symlink()` takes whole, so the class is gone by
    # construction rather than by review.
    #
    # The contract this call site preserves, verbatim: the message text and
    # ORDER (operators read this output), silence under --json (fd 1 is
    # already stderr there, so `--quiet` suppresses rather than reroutes), and
    # best-effort semantics — a failed link warns and worktree creation still
    # succeeds, which is why the exit code is discarded here and `worktree-link`
    # returns 0 unconditionally.
    #
    # No daemon binary means the links are simply not made: the worktree is
    # usable and merely rebuilds what it could have borrowed. That is the one
    # honest answer for a best-effort step, and unlike the `remove`/`wip`
    # slices there is no destructive operation whose silent skip could be
    # mistaken for a completed one — so it WARNS rather than exiting 2, and
    # `worktree.sh <issue>` keeps working on a host with no loom-daemon at all.
    # $_LEASE_DAEMON_BIN is resolved at pre-flight above; the name is
    # historical (#8193) and it is simply "the daemon that implements this
    # script", honouring $LOOM_DAEMON_SELF_BIN.
