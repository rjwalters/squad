# locate-daemon-bin.sh — Resolve the loom-daemon binary to invoke.
#
# Source this file (do not exec). Defines four functions — and the split
# between the first pair and the second pair is the point (#8134):
#
#   $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN      the daemon a caller MANAGES or PROBES — the install
#                         whose version is compared, the socket endpoint a
#                         watchdog round-trips, a deliberately fake binary in a
#                         test. Resolved by loom_locate_daemon_bin below.
#   $LOOM_DAEMON_SELF_BIN the daemon that IMPLEMENTS the caller's own logic —
#                         what a Shape-A stub execs its subcommand on.
#                         Resolved by loom_daemon_self_bin_override /
#                         loom_resolve_self_daemon_bin further down.
#
# One variable cannot mean both: a suite that pins $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN to a probe
# mock would otherwise also redirect the stub into that mock (the #8134 hang).
# Which one a new caller wants is a question about the caller, not about the
# repo: "is this the binary I run, or the binary I inspect?"
#
#   loom_locate_daemon_bin <repo_root> -> echoes the absolute path to a
#   loom-daemon binary on stdout, or an empty string if none could be
#   resolved.
#
#   loom_daemon_bin_search_paths <repo_root> -> echoes the ordered list of
#   locations that WOULD be checked (one per line, in precedence order),
#   for use in "binary not found" error text. Does not write to the
#   filesystem -- it just renders the same candidate list
#   loom_locate_daemon_bin walks (which, since #6208, can include a
#   read-only `cargo metadata` call -- see _loom_daemon_repo_candidates()).
#
# Resolution precedence (first match wins):
#   1. $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN — must be executable.
#   2. Only when $LOOM_PREFER_REPO_BUILD=1: the build-output-relative
#      candidates under <repo_root> (see step 4 below), hoisted above the
#      installed binary so a developer who just `cargo build`ed in a
#      checkout runs what they built instead of a stale
#      $HOME/.local/bin/loom-daemon (#4997). Off by default — the plain
#      `loom-daemon-start.sh` / `.loom/bin/loom` production path must keep
#      preferring the machine-level install unconditionally.
#   3. `loom-daemon` on PATH.
#   4. The machine-level install location: $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR (default
#      $HOME/.local/bin) — this is where loom-daemon-update.sh's --provision
#      path installs, and the location `ssh host 'cmd'` (a non-interactive
#      shell that never sources the login profile, so $HOME/.local/bin is
#      NOT on PATH) needs an explicit check for (#4875).
#   5. Build-output-relative candidates under <repo_root>, honoring a
#      redirected $CARGO_TARGET_DIR / build.target-dir (#6208):
#        $CARGO_TARGET_DIR/release/loom-daemon (if $CARGO_TARGET_DIR is set)
#        $CARGO_TARGET_DIR/debug/loom-daemon   (if $CARGO_TARGET_DIR is set)
#        loom-daemon/target/release/loom-daemon
#        loom-daemon/target/debug/loom-daemon
#        target/release/loom-daemon
#        target/debug/loom-daemon
#        <cargo metadata's target_directory>/release/loom-daemon (fallback)
#        <cargo metadata's target_directory>/debug/loom-daemon   (fallback)
#
# Extracted (issue #4080) from the identical inline copies in
# loom-daemon-start.sh and loom-daemon-update.sh so probe-tokens.sh's
# daemon-binary resolution does not add a fourth copy of this logic. #4875
# added the machine-level install fallback (step 4) plus
# loom_daemon_bin_search_paths(), and migrated the remaining inline copies in
# loom-daemon-start.sh / loom-daemon-watchdog.sh / loom-daemon-update.sh /
# loom-status.sh / .loom/bin/loom onto this single shared definition so a
# future new candidate path never has to be ported by hand across six copies
# again. #4997 added the diagnostic stderr line (every resolution names the
# path + provenance + mtime it landed on, so "which binary ran" is always
# answerable from a sweep/session log) and the opt-in $LOOM_PREFER_REPO_BUILD
# precedence hoist (step 2). #6208 taught the repo-local candidates (steps 2
# and 5) to also honor a redirected $CARGO_TARGET_DIR / ~/.cargo/config.toml's
# build.target-dir (resolved via `cargo metadata`, mirroring the build-time
# fix for loom-daemon-update.sh in #6160/#6209) instead of only ever probing
# the four historical hardcoded paths -- see _loom_daemon_repo_candidates().
#
# $LOOM_LOCATE_DAEMON_BIN_QUIET=1 suppresses the #4997 resolution-trace line
# above for a single call (default unset, i.e. the trace still prints — this
# is opt-in per-caller, not a global behavior change). Added for #6392: a
# caller that execs straight into the resolved binary (e.g.
# recover-orphaned-shepherds.sh) and inherits its stderr can otherwise leave
# this *success* trace as the only line an operator ever sees on a
# subsequent non-zero exit — read at a glance it looks like a failure
# reason, but it always reports a successful resolution. Set this only when
# the resolved binary's own stderr is the more useful signal; leave it unset
# anywhere "which binary ran" is itself the diagnostic (the common case).

# Best-effort mtime, formatted for a human-readable log line. GNU `stat -c`
# first (illegal option on BSD/macOS, so it fails cleanly there), then BSD
# `stat -f`. Echoes "unknown" if neither works (e.g. the path vanished
# between resolution and logging) rather than failing the caller.

# it in a test fixture): loom_locate_daemon_bin / $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN name the
# INSTALLED daemon a script MANAGES -- the one whose version is compared, which
# may be an old release with no `retry-classify` / `release-resolve`
# subcommand at all, and which during a test is a deliberately fake binary.
# Exec'ing a ported subcommand on that is a category error.
#
# Resolution order, most explicit first:
#   1. $LOOM_DAEMON_SELF_BIN -- must be executable. The seam a test or an
#      operator uses to name the implementation directly.
#   2. A build in THIS checkout ($CARGO_TARGET_DIR honored, release then debug).
#      Script-relative first: this library lives at <checkout>/defaults/scripts/lib/
#      (or <consumer>/.loom/scripts/lib/), so the build that implements the
#      logic THIS COPY delegates to is the one in the checkout this copy came
#      from -- not whatever $REPO_ROOT happens to be (in a test fixture,
#      $REPO_ROOT is the fixture, which has no build at all). $REPO_ROOT is
#      still probed after it, for the caller that has one.
#   3. `loom-daemon` on PATH.
# Echoes "" when none resolves; the caller then answers in its own contract
# (a fail-safe verdict, not a crash) rather than failing silently.
#
# Lives here, beside loom_locate_daemon_bin, so the two resolutions sit next to
# each other and the distinction above is unmissable. Extracted from
# cli/loom-daemon-update.sh by #8037, when claude-wrapper.sh became the second
