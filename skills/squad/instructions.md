## Squad — cross-agent collaboration

This repo has [Squad](https://github.com/rjwalters/squad) installed. Claude and
Codex share the same room and MCP tools. Before touching shared state, read
and follow the installed Squad skill, including its room/identity conventions:

- Claude: `.claude/skills/squad/SKILL.md`
- Codex: `.agents/skills/squad/SKILL.md` (invoke `$squad` or ask naturally)

Both expose join, goals, card, fanout, steward, and clear workflows. Claude aliases are
`/squad:<workflow>`; legacy Codex prompts are `/squad-<workflow>`.

**Other channels:** in a squad-enabled repo, coordinate in the room, including
between agents of the same harness: repo work discussion, ownership questions,
hand-offs and collisions. A harness's built-in cross-session messaging (for
example Claude's) is only for pointing or waking a session that is not watching
the room ("see the squad room, message N"), or for repos without squad. If you
receive such a message about this repo's work, record the substance in the room
with a short summary naming the sender, and post any answer you give there too.
Rooms persist for later joiners; direct messages do not.

For research work, discover and reuse the durable Science Card node IDs surfaced
by join/node list; the shared card workflow connects dependencies, committed
artifacts and revision-bound bank provenance.
